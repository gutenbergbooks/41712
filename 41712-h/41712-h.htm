<p class="in0 p2"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="dropleftmin">ITH</span> an exclamation of impatience, Waseche
Bill pushed a formidable looking volume
from him and sat, pen in hand, scowling down at
the sheet of writing paper upon the table before
him. "I done give fo' dollahs fo' that dictionary
down to Faihbanks an' it ain't wo'th fo' bits!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?" grinned Connie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Morgan, glancing across the table into the face of
his partner.</p>

<p>"The main matteh with it is that it ain't no
good. It's plumb full of a lot of wo'ds that no one
wouldn't know what yo' was talkin' about if yo'
said 'em, an' the common ones a man has got some
use fo' is left out."</p>

<p>"What word do you want? I learned to spell
quite a lot of words in school."</p>

<p>"Gillum."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Gillum&mdash;I want to write a letteh to Mike Gillum.
They ain't no betteh man nowheahs than
Mike. He's known all along the Tanana an' in
the loggin' woods outside, an' heah's this book that
sets up to show folks how to spell, an' it cain't even
spell Mike Gillum."</p>

<p>Connie laughed. "Gillum is a proper name,"
he explained, "and dictionaries don't print proper
names."</p>

<p>"They might a heap betteh leave out some of the
impropeh an' redic'lous ones they've got into 'em,
then, an' put in some of the propeh ones. I ain't
pleased with that book, nohow. It ain't no good.
It claims fo' to show how to spell wo'ds, an' when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
yo' come to use it yo' got to know how to spell the
wo'd yo' huntin' fo' oah yo' cain't find it. The
only wo'ds yo' c'n find when yo' want 'em is the
ones yo' c'n spell anyhow, so what's the use of
findin' 'em?"</p>

<p>"But, there's the definitions. It tells you what
the words mean."</p>

<p>Waseche Bill snorted contemptuously. "What
they mean!" he exclaimed. "Well, if yo' didn't
know what they mean, yo' wouldn't be wantin' to
use them, nohow, an' yo' wouldn't care a doggone
how they was spelt, noah if they was spelt at all
oah not. Fact is, I didn't give the matteh no
thought when I bought it. If it had be'n a big deal
I wouldn't have be'n took in, that way. In the
hotel at Faihbanks, it was, when I was comin' in.
The fellow I bought it off of seemed right pleased
with the book. Why, he talked enough about it to
of sold a claim. I got right tired listenin' to him,
so I bought it. But, shucks, I might of know'd if
the book had be'n any good he wouldn't have be'n
so anxious to get red of it."</p>

<p>"Where is this Mike Gillum?" Connie asked, as
he folded a paper and returned it to a little pile of
similar papers that lay before him on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't jest recollec' now, but I got the place
copied down in my notebook. It's some town
back in Minnesota."</p>

<p>"Minnesota!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Fact is we be'n so blamed busy all summeh
right heah in Ten Bow, I'd plumb forgot
about ouh otheh interests, till the nippy weatheh
done reminded me of 'em."</p>

<p>"I didn't know we had any other interests,"
smiled the boy.</p>

<p>"It's this way," began Waseche Bill, as he applied
a match to his pipe and settled back in his
chair. "When I was down to the hospital last fall
they brought in a fellow fo' an operation an' put
him in the room next to mine. The first day he
stuck his nose out the do', I seen it was Mike Gillum&mdash;we'd
prospected togetheh oveh on the Tanana,
yeahs back, an' yo' bet yo' boots I was glad to
see someone that had been up heah in the big
country an' could talk sensible about it without
askin' a lot of fool questions about what do the
dawgs drink in winteh if everythin's froze up?
An' ain't we afraid we'll freeze to death? An' how
high is the mountains? An' did you know my
mother's cousin that went up to Alaska after gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in '98? While he was gettin' well, we had some
great old powwows, an' he told me how he done
got sick of prospectin' an' went back to loggin'.
He's a fo'man, now, fo' some big lumbeh syndicate
in one of theih camps up in no'the'n Minnesota."</p>

<p>"One day we was settin' a smokin' ouh pipes an'
he says to me, 'Waseche,' he says, 'you've got the
dust to do it with, why don't you take a li'l flyeh
in timbeh?' I allowed minin' was mo' in my line,
an' he says, 'That's all right, but this heah timbeh
business is a big proposition, too. Jest because a
man's got one good thing a-goin', ain't no sign he'd
ort to pass up anotheh. It's this way,' he says:
'Up to'ds the haid of Dogfish Riveh, they's a four-thousand-acre
tract of timbeh that's surrounded on
three sides by the Syndicate holdin's. Fo' yeahs
the Syndicate's be'n tryin' to get holt of this tract,
but the man that owns it would die befo' he'd let
'em put an axe to a stick of it. They done him
dirt some way a long time ago an' he's neveh fo'got
it. He ain't got the capital to log it, an' he won't
sell to the Syndicate. But he needs the money, an'
if some private pahty come along that would take
it off his hands an' agree to neveh sell it to the Syndicate,
he could drive a mighty good ba'gain. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
know logs,' Mike says, 'an' I'm tellin' yo' there
ain't a betteh strip of timbeh in the State.'</p>

<p>"'Why ain't no one grabbed it befo'?' I asks.</p>

<p>"'Because this heah McClusky that owns it is a
mighty suspicious ol' man, an' he's tu'ned down
about a hund'ed offehs because he know'd they
was backed by the Syndicate.'</p>

<p>"'Maybe he'd tu'n down mine, if I'd make him
one,' I says.</p>

<p>"Mike laughed. 'No,' he says, 'spite of the
fact that I'm one of the Syndicate's fo'men, ol'
man McClusky takes my wo'd fo' anything I tell
him. Him an' my ol' dad come oveh f'om Ireland
togetheh. I'd go a long ways around to do ol'
Mac a good tu'n, an' he knows it. Fact is, it's me
that put him wise that most of the offehs he's had
come from the Syndicate&mdash;my contract with 'em
callin' fo' handlin' loggin' crews, an' not helpin'
'em skin folks out of their timbeh. If I'd slip the
we'd to Mac to sell to you, he'd sell.'"</p>

<p>Waseche refilled his pipe, and Connie waited
eagerly for his big partner to proceed. "Well,"
continued the man, "he showed me how it was an
awful good proposition, so I agreed to take it oveh.
I wanted Mike should come in on it, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
wouldn't&mdash;Mike's squah as a die, an' he said his
contract has got three mo' yeahs to run, an' it binds
him not to engage in no private business oah entehprise
whateveh while it's in fo'ce.</p>

<p>"Befo'e Mike left the hospital he sent fo' McClusky,
an' we closed the deal. That was last
fall, an' I told Mike that as long as the timbeh was
theah, I might's well staht gettin' it out. He
wa'ned me to keep my eye on the Syndicate when
I stahted to layin' 'em down, but befo'e he'd got
a chance to give me much advice on the matteh,
theah come a telegram fo' him to get to wo'k an'
line up his crew an' get into the woods. Befo'e he
left, though, he said he'd send me down a man that
might do fo' a fo'man. Said he couldn't vouch for
him no mo'n that he was a tiptop logman, an' capable
of handlin' a crew in the woods. So he come,
Jake Hurley, his name is, an' he's a big red Irishman.
I didn't jest like his looks, an' some of his
talk, but I didn't know wheah to get anyone else
so I took a chance on him an' hired him to put a
crew into the woods an' get out a small lot of timbeh."
Waseche Bill crossed the room and, unlocking
a chest, tossed a packet of papers onto the
table. "It's all in theah," he said grimly. "They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
got out quite a mess of logs, an' in the spring when
they was drivin' 'em
down the Dogfish
Riveh, to get 'em
into the Mississippi,
they fouled a Syndicate
drive. When
things got straightened
out, we was
fo'teen thousan' dollahs
to the bad."</p>

<p>The little clock
ticked for a long
time while Connie
carefully examined
the sheaf of papers.
After a while he
looked up. "Why,
if it hadn't been for
losing our logs we
would have cleaned
up a good profit!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<span class="caption">HURLEY</span>
</div>

<p>Waseche Bill nodded. "Yes&mdash;if. But the fact
is, we didn't clean up no profit, an' we got the tract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
on ouh hands with no one to sell it to, cause I
passed ouh wo'd I wouldn't sell it&mdash;o' co'se McClusky
couldn't hold us to that acco'din' to law,
but I reckon, he won't have to. I got us into this
heah mess unbeknownst to you, so I'll jest shouldeh
the loss, private, an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll <i>what!</i>" interrupted Connie, wrathfully.
And then grinned good-humouredly as he detected
the twinkle in Waseche Bill's eye.</p>

<p>"I said, I c'n get a raise out of yo' any time I'm a
mind to try, cain't I?"</p>

<p>"You sure can," laughed the boy. "But just
so you don't forget it, we settled this partnership
business for good and all, a couple of years ago."</p>

<p>Waseche nodded as he glanced affectionately
into the face of the boy. "Yes, son, I reckon
that's done settled," he answered, gravely. "But
the question is, now we ah into this thing, how we
goin' to get out?"</p>

<p>"Fight out, of course!" exclaimed the boy, his
eyes flashing. "The first thing for us to find out is,
whether the fouling of that drive was accidental or
was done purposely. And why we didn't get what
was coming to us when the logs were sorted."</p>

<p>"I reckon that's done settled, as fah as <i>knowin'</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
it's conse'ned. Provin' it will be anotheh matteh."
He produced a letter from his pocket. "This
come up in the mail," he said. "It's from Mike
Gillum. Mike, he writes a middlin' sho't letteh,
but he says a heap. It was wrote from Riverville,
Minnesota, on July the tenth."</p>

<blockquote class="nobreak">

<p class="in0 smcap">"Friend Waseche:
</p>

<p>"Just found out Hurley is on pay roll of the
Syndicate. Look alive.</p>

<p class="smcap sigright">"Mike."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Double crossed us," observed the boy, philosophically.</p>

<p>"Yes, an' the wo'st of it is, he wouldn't sign up
without a two-yeah contract. Said some yeahs a
boss has bad luck an' he'd ort to be give a chance
to make good."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it," said Connie. "I think he'll
get his chance, all right."</p>

<p>Waseche looked at his small partner quizzically.
"What do yo' mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Let's go to bed. It's late," observed the boy,
evasively. "Maybe in the morning we'll have it
doped out."</p>

<p>At breakfast the following morning Connie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
looked at Waseche Bill, and Waseche looked at
Connie. "I guess it's up to me," smiled the
boy.</p>

<p>"Yo' mean&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I mean that the only way to handle this case is
to handle it from the bottom up. First we've got
to get this Jake Hurley with the goods, and when
we've got him out of the way, jump in and show the
Syndicate that they've run up against an outfit it
don't pay to monkey with. That timber is ours,
and we're going to have it!"</p>

<p>"That sums the case right pert as fa' as talkin'
goes, but how we goin' to do it? If we go down
theah an' kick Hurley out, we've got to pay him fo'
a whole winteh's wo'k he ain't done an' I'd hate to
do that. We don't neitheh one of us know enough
about loggin' to run the camp, an' if we was to
hunt up anotheh fo'man, chances is he'd be as bad
as Hurley, mebbe wo'se."</p>

<p>"There's no use in both of us going. You're
needed here, and besides there wouldn't be much
you could do if you were there. Hurley don't
know me, and I can go down and get enough on
him by spring to put him away where he can think
things over for a while. I've just finished a year's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
experience in handling exactly such characters as
he is."</p>

<p>Waseche Bill grinned. "I met up with Dan
McKeeveh comin' in," he said. "From what I
was able to getheh, heahin' him talk, I reckon they
cain't be many bad men left oveh on the Yukon
side."</p>

<p>"Dan was prejudiced," laughed Connie. "I
did just what any one else would have done&mdash;what
good men any place you put 'em have <i>got</i> to do,
or they wouldn't be good men. After I'd found
out what had to be done, I figured out the most
sensible way of doing it, and then did it the best I
knew how. I haven't lived with men like you, and
Dan, and MacDougall, and the rest of the boys,
for nothing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jest yo' stick to that way of doin', son, an', I
reckon, yo'll find it's about all the Bible yo'll need.
But, about this heah trip to the outside. I sho'
do hate to have yo' go down theh, so fah away from
anywhehs. S'posin' somethin' should happen to
yo'. Why, I don't reckon I eveh would get oveh
blamin' myself fo' lettin' yo' go."</p>

<p>"Any one would think I was a girl," smiled the
boy. "But I guess if I can take care of myself up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
here, I can handle anything I'll run up against
outside."</p>

<p>"What do yo' aim to do when yo' get theah?"</p>

<p>"The first thing to do will be to hunt up Mike
Gillum and have a talk with him. After that&mdash;well,
after that, I'll know what to do."</p>

<p>Waseche Bill regarded the boy thoughtfully as
he passed his fingers slowly back and forth along
his stub-bearded jaw. "I reckon yo' will, son,"
he said, "from what I know of yo', an' what Dan
done tol' me, comin' in, I jest reckon yo' will."</p>

<p>When Connie Morgan made up his mind to do a
thing he went ahead and did it. Inside of a week
the boy had packed his belongings, bid good-bye
to Ten Bow, and started upon the journey that was
to take him far from his beloved Alaska, and plunge
him into a series of adventures that were to pit
his wits against the machinations of a scheming
corporation.</p>

<span class="smaller">HURLEY</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="dropleftmin">ITH</span> a long-drawn whistle the great trans-continental
train ground to a stop at a tiny
town that consisted simply of a red painted depot,
a huge water tank, and a dozen or more low frame
houses, all set in a little clearing that was hardly
more than a notch in one of the parallel walls of
pine that flanked the railroad. The coloured porter
glanced contemptuously out of the window and
grumbled at the delay. The conductor, a dapper
little man of blue cloth and brass buttons, bustled
importantly down the aisle and disappeared
through the front door. Connie raised his window
and thrust his head out. Other heads protruded
from the long line of coaches, and up in front men
were swinging from the platforms to follow the
trainmen who were hurrying along the sides of the
cars. Connie arose and made his way forward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Two days and nights in the cramped quarters of
the car had irked the boy, used as he was to the
broad, open places, and it was with a distinct feeling
of relief that he stepped to the ground and
breathed deeply of the pine-scented air.</p>

<p>Upon a siding stood several flat cars onto which
a dozen or more roughly dressed men were busily
loading gear and equipment under the eye of a
massive-framed giant of a man in a shirt of brilliant
red flannel, who sat dangling his legs from the
brake wheel of the end car. A stubble of red
beard covered the man's undershot jaw. The
visor of a greasy plush cap, pushed well back upon
his head, disclosed a shock of red hair that nearly
met the shaggy eyebrows beneath which a pair of
beady eyes kept tab on the movements of his crew.
To the stalled train, and the people who passed
close beside him, the man gave no heed.</p>

<p>Up ahead, some eight or ten rods in front of the
monster engine that snorted haughty impatience
to be gone, Connie saw the cause of the delay.
A heavy, underslung logging wagon was stalled
directly upon the tracks, where it remained fixed
despite the efforts of the four big horses that were
doing their utmost to move it in response to a loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
string of abusive epithets and the stinging blows of
a heavy whip which the driver wielded with the
strength of a husky arm. A little knot of men
collected about the wagon, and the driver, abandoning
his vain attempt to start the load, addressed
the crowd in much the same language he had used
toward the horses. The train conductor detached
himself from the group and hurried toward the
flat cars.</p>

<p>"Hey, you," he piped, "are you the boss of this
crew?"</p>

<p>The huge man upon the brake wheel paid him
no heed, but bawled a profane reprimand for the
misplacing of a coil of wire line.</p>

<p>"Hey, you, I say!" The little conductor was
fairly dancing impatience. "You, Red Shirt!
Are you the boss?"</p>

<p>The wire line having been shifted to suit him,
the other condescended to glare down into the
speaker's face. "I be&mdash;what's loose with you?"</p>

<p>"Get that wagon off the track! You've held us
up ten minutes already! It's an outrage!"</p>

<p>"Aw, go chase yersilf! Whad'ye s'pose I care av
yer tin minutes late, er tin hours? I've got trouble
av me own."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"You get that wagon moved!" shrilled the conductor.
"You're obstructing the United States
mail, and I guess you know what that means!"</p>

<p>Reference to the mail evidently had its effect
upon the boss, for he very deliberately clambered
to the ground and made his way leisurely toward the
stalled wagon. "Give 'em the gad, ye wooden head!
What ye standin' there wid yer mout' open fer?"</p>

<p>Once more the driver plied his heavy lash and
the big horses strained to the pull. But it was of
no avail.</p>

<p>"They can't pull it, it ain't any good to lick
'em," remonstrated the engineer. "A couple of
you boys climb up and throw some of that stuff
off. We can't wait here all day."</p>

<p>The fireman and the brakeman started toward
the load, but were confronted by the glowering
boss. "Ye'll lay off a couple av trips while they
fan ye back to life, av ye try ut!" he roared. The
men turned back, and the boss addressed the engineer.
"You try ut yersilf, av ye're lookin' fer a
nice little lay-off in the hospital. Av ye lay here
all day an' all night, too, ye've got no wan but yer
company to thank. Who was ut put them rotten
planks in that crossin'?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The engineer possessed a certain diplomacy that
the conductor did not.</p>

<p>"Sure, it's the company's fault. Any one can
see that. They've got no business putting such
rotten stuff into their crossings. I didn't want to
butt in on you, boss, but if you'll just tell us what
to do we'll help you get her out of there."</p>

<p>The boss regarded him with suspicion, but the
engineer was smiling in a friendly fashion, and the
boss relented a little. "Mostly, ut's the company's
fault, but partly ut's the fault av that
blockhead av a teamster av mine. He ain't fit to
drive a one-horse phaeton fer an owld woman's
home." While the boss talked he eyed the stalled
wagon critically. "Come over here, a couple av
you sleepwalkers!" he called, and when the men
arrived from the flat cars, he ripped out his orders
almost in a breath. "Git a plank befront that
hind wheel to ride ut over the rail! You frog-eater,
there, that calls yersilf a teamster&mdash;cramp them
horses hard to the right! Freeze onto the spokes
now, ye sons av rest, an' <span class="smcap">ROLL 'ER</span>!" Once more
the big horses threw their weight into the traces,
and the men on the wheels lifted and strained but
the wagon held fast. For a single instant the boss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
looked on, then with a growl he leaped toward the
wagon.</p>

<p>"Throw the leather into 'em, Frenchy! Make
thim leaders pull up!" Catching the man on the
offending hind wheel by the shoulder he sent him
spinning to the side of the track, and stooping,
locked his thick fingers about a spoke, set his great
shoulder against the tire and with legs spread wide,
heaved upward. The load trembled, hesitated an
instant, and moved slowly, the big boss fairly lifting
the wheel up the short incline. A moment
later it rolled away toward the flat cars, followed
by the boss and his crew.</p>

<p>"Beef and bluff," grinned Connie to himself as
the crowd of passengers returned to the coaches.</p>

<p>Connie found Mike Gillum busily stowing potatoes
in an underground root cellar. "He's almost
as big as the man with the red shirt," thought the
boy as he watched Mike read the note Waseche
Bill had given him before he left Ten Bow.</p>

<p>The man paused in the middle to stare incredulously
at the boy. "D'ye mane," he asked, in his
rich Irish brogue, "thot ut's yersilf's the pardner
av Waseche Bill&mdash;a kid loike you, the pardner av
<i>him</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Connie laughed; and unconsciously his shoulders
stiffened. "Yes," he answered proudly, "we've
been partners for two years."</p>

<p>Still the man appeared incredulous. "D'ye
mane ye're the wan thot he wuz tellin' thrailed him
beyant the Ogilvies into the Lillimuit? An' put in
the time whilst he wuz in the hospital servin' wid
the Mounted? Moind ye, lad, Oi've be'n in the
Narth mesilf, an' Oi know summat av it's ways."</p>

<p>"Yes, but maybe Waseche bragged me up more
than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mike Gillum interrupted him by thrusting forth
a grimy hand. "Br-ragged ye up, is ut! An-ny
one thot c'n do the things ye've done, me b'y, don't
nade no braggin' up. Ut's proud Oi am to know
ye&mdash;Waseche towld me ye wuz ondly a kid, but Oi
had in me moind a shtrappin' young blade av
mebbe ut's twinty-foor or -five, not a wee shtrip av
a lad loike ye. Come on in the house till Oi wash
up a bit, thim praties has got me back fair bruk
a'ready."</p>

<p>The big Irishman would not hear of the boy's
putting up at a hotel, and after supper the two sat
upon the foreman's little veranda that overlooked
the river and talked until far into the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"So ye've got to kape yer oye on um, lad," the
Irishman concluded, after a long discourse upon
the ins and outs, and whys and wherefores of the
logging situation on Dogfish. "Ut's mesilf'll give
you all the help Oi can, faylin' raysponsible fer
sindin' him to Waseche. There's divilmint in the
air fer this winter. The Syndicate's goin' to put
a camp on Dogfish below ye, same as last winter.
Oi've wor-rked fer um long enough to know ut's
only to buck you folks they're doin' ut, fer their
plans wuz not to do an-ny cuttin' on the Dogfish
tract fer several years to come. Whin Oi heard
they wuz goin' to put a camp there Oi applied fer
the job av bossin' ut, but they towld me Oi wuz
nayded over on Willow River." Mike Gillum
knocked the dottle from his pipe and grinned
broadly. "'Twuz a complimint they paid me,"
he said. "They know me loike Oi know thim&mdash;av
there's crooked wor-ruk to be done in a camp, they
take care that Oi ain't the boss av ut. But Willow
River is only tin miles back&mdash;due narth av the
McClusky tract."</p>

<span class="caption">MIKE GILLUM TOOK CONNIE TO THE RIVER WHERE MILES OF
BOOMS HELD MILLIONS OF FEET OF LOGS</span>
</div>

<p>The next morning Mike Gillum took Connie to
the river where miles of booms held millions of
feet of logs which awaited their turn at the saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>mills
whose black smoke belched from stacks at
some distance downstream where the river plunged
over the apron of the dam in a mad whirl of white
water.</p>

<p>"How can they tell which mill the logs are to go
to?" asked the boy, as he gazed out over the acres
of boomed timber.</p>

<p>"Each log carries uts mark, they're sorted in the
river. We'll walk on down where ye c'n see um
jerked drippin' to the saws."</p>

<p>"Does Hurley live here?" asked Connie, as the
two followed the river bank toward the dam.</p>

<p>"Naw, he lives at Pine Hook, down the road
a ways. Ut's about time he wuz showin' up,
though. He lays in his supplies an' fills in his
crew here. He towld me last spring he wuz goin'
to run two camps this winter." They were close
above the dam and had to raise their voices to
make themselves heard above the roar of the
water that dashed over the apron.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Connie, suddenly, pointing toward
a slender green canoe that floated in the current
at a distance of a hundred yards or so from
shore, and the same distance above the falls.
"There's a woman in it and she's in trouble!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a><br /><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
The big Irishman looked, shading his eyes with his
hands.</p>

<p>"She's losin' ground!" he exclaimed. "She's
caught in the suck av the falls!" The light craft
was pointed upstream and the woman was paddling
frantically, but despite her utmost efforts the canoe
was being drawn slowly toward the brink of the
white water apron.</p>

<p>With a roar the big Irishman sprang to the
water's edge and raced up the bank toward a tiny
wharf to which were tied several skiffs with their
oars in the locks. Connie measured the distance
with his eye. "He'll never make it!" he decided,
and jerking off coat and shoes, rushed to the water.
"Keep paddling, ma'am!" he called at the top of
his lungs, and plunged in. With swift, sure strokes
the boy struck out for the canoe. The woman saw
him coming and redoubled her efforts.</p>

<p>"Come back, ye idiot!" bellowed a voice from
the bank, but Connie did not even turn his head.
He had entered the water well upstream from the
little craft, and the current bore him down upon
it as he increased his distance from shore. A moment
later he reached up and grasped the gunwale.
"Keep paddling!" he urged, as he drew himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
slowly over the bow, at the same time keeping the
canoe in perfect balance. "Where's your other
paddle?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"There's&mdash;only&mdash;this," panted the woman.</p>

<p>"Give it here!" cried the boy sharply, "and lie
flat in the bottom! We've got to go over the
dam!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" shrieked the woman, "we'll be
killed! Several&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a growl of impatience, Connie wrenched
the paddle from her hands. "Lie down, or I'll
knock you down!" he thundered, and with a moan
of terror the woman sank to the bottom of the
canoe. Kneeling low, the boy headed the frail
craft for a narrow strip of water that presented an
unbroken, oily surface as it plunged over the apron.
On either hand the slope showed only the churning
white water. Connie gave one glance toward
the bank where a little knot of men had collected,
and the next moment the canoe shot, head on,
straight over the brink of the falls. For an instant
it seemed to hang suspended with half its length
hanging over, clear of the water. Then it shot
downward to bury its bow in the smother of boiling
churning, white water at the foot of the apron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
For a moment it seemed to Connie as though the
canoe were bound to be swamped. It rolled loggily
causing the water it had shipped to slosh over the
clothing and face of the limp form of the woman in
the bottom. The boy was afraid she would attempt
to struggle free of it, but she lay perfectly
still. She had fainted. The canoe hesitated for a
moment, wobbling uncertainly, as the overroll at
the foot of the falls held it close against the apron,
then it swung heavily into the grip of an eddy and
Connie at length succeeded in forcing it toward the
bank, wallowing so low in the water that the gunwales
were nearly awash.</p>

<p>Eager hands grasped the bow as it scraped upon
the shore, and while the men lifted the still form
from the bottom, Connie slipped past them and
made his way to the place he had left his coat and
shoes.</p>

<p>Mike Gillum met him at the top of the bank.</p>

<p>"Arrah! Me laddie, ut's a gr-rand thrick ye
pulled! No wan but a <i>tillicum</i> av the Narth

an'&mdash;" He stopped abruptly and glanced toward
the river. "Shpakin' av Hurley&mdash;there he comes,
now!" he whispered, and Connie glanced up to see
a huge man advancing toward them at the head of
a little group that approached from the point where
he had landed the canoe. The boy stared in
amazement&mdash;it was the red-shirted giant of the
stalled wagon.</p>

<p>"So that's Hurley," said he, quietly. "Well,
here's where I strike him for a job."</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HE</span> upshot of Connie Morgan's interview with
Hurley, the big red-shirted camp boss, was
that the boss hired him with the injunction to show
up bright and early the following morning, as the
train that was to haul the outfit to the Dogfish
Spur would leave at daylight.</p>

<p>"'Tiz a foine job ye've got&mdash;wor-rkin' f'r forty
dollars a month in yer own timber," grinned big
Mike Gillum, as he packed the tobacco into
the bowl of his black pipe, when the two found
themselves once more seated upon the Syndicate
foreman's little veranda at the conclusion of the
evening meal.</p>

<p>Connie laughed. "Yes, but it will amount to a
good deal more than forty dollars a month if I can
save the timber. We lost fourteen thousand dollars
last year because those logs got mixed. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
don't see yet how he worked it. You say the logs
are all branded."</p>

<p>"Who knows what brands he put on 'em? Or,
wuz they branded at all? They wuz sorted in th'
big river but the drive was fouled in the Dogfish.
S'pose the heft of your logs wuz branded wid the
Syndicate brand&mdash;or no brand at all? The wans
that wuz marked for the Syndicate w'd go to
Syndicate mills, an' the wans that wuzn't branded
w'd go into the pool, to be awarded pro raty to all
outfits that had logs in the drive."</p>

<p>"I'll bet the right brand will go onto them this
year!" exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>Mike Gillum nodded. "That's what ye're there
for. But, don't star-rt nawthin' 'til way along
towards spring. Jake Hurley's a boss that can get
out the logs&mdash;an' that's what you want. Av ye
wuz to tip off yer hand too soon, the best ye c'd do
w'd be to bust up the outfit wid nawthin' to show
f'r the season's expenses. Keep yer eyes open an'
yer mout' shut. Not only ye must watch Hurley,
but keep an eye on the scaler, an' check up the
time book, an' the supplies&mdash;av course ye c'n only
do the two last av he puts ye to clerking, an' Oi'm
thinkin' that's what he'll do. Ut's either clerk or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
cookee f'r you, an most an-ny wan w'd do f'r a
cookee."</p>

<p>The foreman paused, and Connie saw a twinkle
in his eye as he continued: "Ye see, sometimes a
boss overestimates the number av min he's got
workin'. Whin he makes out the pay roll he writes
in a lot av names av min that's mebbe worked f'r
him years back, an' is dead, or mebbe it's just a
lot av names av min that ain't lived yet, but might
be born sometime; thin whin pay day comes the
boss signs the vouchers an' sticks the money in his
pockets. Moind ye, I ain't sayin' Hurley done
that but he'd have a foine chanct to, wid his owner
way up in Alaska. An' now we'll be goin' to bed
f'r ye have to git up early. Oi'll be on Willow River;
av they's an-nything Oi c'n do, ye c'n let me
know."</p>

<p>Connie thanked his friend, and before he turned
in, wrote a letter to his partner in Ten Bow:</p>

<blockquote class="nobreak">

<p class="smcap in0">"Dear Waseche:</p>

<p>"I'm O.K. How are you? Got the job. Don't
write. Mike Gillum is O. K. See you in the
spring.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span style="padding-right: 3em;">"Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">"C. Morgan."</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Before daylight Connie was at the siding where
the two flat cars loaded at Pine Hook, and two box
cars that contained the supplies and the horses
were awaiting the arrival of the freight train that
was to haul them seventy miles to Dogfish Spur.
Most of the crew was there before him. Irishmen,
Norwegians, Swedes, Frenchmen, and two or
three Indians, about thirty-five in all, swarmed
upon the cars or sat in groups upon the ground.
Hurley was here, there, and everywhere, checking
up his crew, and giving the final round of inspection
to his supplies.</p>

<p>A long whistle sounded, and the headlight of a
locomotive appeared far down the track. Daylight
was breaking as the heavy train stopped to
pick up the four cars. Connie climbed with the
others to the top of a box car and deposited his
turkey beside him upon the running board. The
turkey consisted of a grain sack tied at either end
with a rope that passed over the shoulder, and
contained the outfit of clothing that Mike Gillum
had advised him to buy. The tops of the cars
were littered with similar sacks, their owners using
them as seats or pillows.</p>

<p>As the train rumbled into motion and the build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>ings
of the town dropped into the distance, the
conductor made his way over the tops of the cars
followed closely by Hurley. Together they counted
the men and the conductor checked the count with
a memorandum. Then he went back to the caboose,
and Hurley seated himself beside Connie.</p>

<p>"Ever work in the woods?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Be'n to school much?"</p>

<p>"Yes, some."</p>

<p>"'Nough to figger up time books, an' keep
track of supplies, an' set down the log figgers
when they're give to you?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Ye look like a smart 'nough kid&mdash;an' ye've got
nerve, all right. I tried to holler ye back when I
seen ye swimmin' out to that canoe yeste'day&mdash;I
didn't think you could make it&mdash;that woman was a
fool. She'd ort to drownded. But, what I was
gettin' at, is this: I'm a goin' to put you to clerkin'.
Clerkin' in a log camp is a good job&mdash;most
bosses was clerks onct. A clerk's s'posed to make
hisself handy around camp an' keep the books&mdash;I'll
show you about them later. We're goin' in
early this year, 'cause I'm goin' to run two camps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
an' we got to lay out the new one an' git it built.
We won't start gittin' out no timber for a month
yet. I'll git things a goin' an' then slip down an'
pick up my crew."</p>

<p>"Why, haven't you got your crew?" Connie
glanced at the men who lay sprawled in little
groups along the tops of the cars.</p>

<p>"Part of it. I'm fetchin' out thirty-five this
time. That's 'nough to build the new camp an'
patch up the old one, but when we begin gittin'
out the logs, this here'll just about make a crew for
the new camp. I figger to work about fifty in the
old one."</p>

<p>"Do you boss both camps?"</p>

<p>Hurly grinned. "Don't I look able?"</p>

<p>"You sure do," agreed the boy, with a glance at
the man's huge bulk.</p>

<p>"They'll only be three or four miles apart, an'
I'll put a boss in each one, an' I'll be the walkin'
boss." The cars jerked and swayed, as the train
roared through the jack pine country.</p>

<p>"I suppose this was all big woods once," ventured
the boy.</p>

<p>"Naw&mdash;not much of it wasn't&mdash;not this jack
pine and scrub spruce country. You can gener'lly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
always tell what was big timber, an' what wasn't.
Pine cuttin's don't seed back to pine. These jack
pines ain't young pine&mdash;they're a different tree altogether.
Years back, the lumbermen wouldn't
look at nawthin' but white pine, an' only the very
best of that&mdash;but things is different now. Yaller
pine and spruce looks good to 'em, an' they're even
cuttin' jack pine. They work it up into mine timbers,
an' posts, an' ties, an' paper pulp. What
with them an' the pig iron loggers workin' the
ridges, this here country'll grow up to hazel brush,
and berries, an' weeds, 'fore your hair turns
grey."</p>

<p>"What are pig iron loggers?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"The hardwood men. They git out the maple
an' oak an' birch along the high ground an' ridges&mdash;they
ain't loggers, they jest think they are."</p>

<p>"You said pine cuttings don't seed back to
pine?"</p>

<p>"Naw, it seems funny, but they don't. Old
cuttin's grow up to popple and scrub oak, like them
with the red leaves, yonder; or else to hazel brush
and berries. There used to be a few patches of
pine through this jack pine country, but it was
soon cut off. This here trac' we're workin' is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
about as good as there is left. With a good crew
we'd ort to make a big cut this winter."</p>

<p>The wheels pounded noisily at the rail ends as
the boss's eyes rested upon the men who sat talking
and laughing among themselves. "An' speakin'
of crews, this here one's goin' to need some cullin'."
He fixed his eyes on the boy with a look almost of
ferocity. "An' here's another thing that a clerk
does, that I forgot to mention: He hears an' sees a
whole lot more'n he talks. You'll bunk in the
shack with me an' the scaler&mdash;an' what's talked
about in there's <i>our</i> business&mdash;d'ye git me?"</p>

<p>Connie returned the glance fearlessly. "I guess
you'll know I can keep a thing or two under
my cap when we get better acquainted," he answered
The reply seemed to satisfy Hurley, who
continued,</p>

<p>"As I was sayin', they's some of them birds
ain't goin' to winter through in no camp of mine.
See them three over there on the end of that next
car, a talkin' to theirselfs. I got an idee they're
I. W. W.'s&mdash;mistrusted they was when I hired
'em."</p>

<p>"What are I. W. W.'s?" Connie asked.</p>

<p>"They're a gang of sneakin' cutthroats that call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
theirselfs the Industrial Workers of the World,
though why they claim they're workers is more'n
what any one knows. They won't work, an' they
won't let no one else work. The only time they
take a job is when they think there's a chanct to
sneak around an' put the kibosh on whatever work
is goin' on. They tell the men they're downtrod
by capital an' they'd ort to raise up an' kill off the
bosses an' grab everything fer theirselfs. Alongside
of them birds, rattlesnakes an' skunks is good
companions."</p>

<p>"Aren't there any laws that will reach them?"</p>

<p>"Naw," growled Hurley in disgust. "When
they git arrested an' convicted, the rest of 'em
raises such a howl that capital owns the courts, an'
the judges is told to hang all the workin' men they
kin, an' a lot of rot like that, till the governors git
cold feet an' pardon them. If the government
used 'em right, it'd outlaw the whole kaboodle of
'em. Some governors has got the nerve to tell 'em
where to head in at&mdash;Washington, an' California,
an' Minnesota, too, is comin' to it. They're
gittin' in their dirty work in the woods&mdash;but believe
me, they won't git away with nothin' in my
camps! I'm just a-layin' an' a-honin' to tear loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
on 'em. Them three birds over there is goin' to
need help when I git through with 'em."</p>

<p>"Why don't you fire 'em now?"</p>

<p>"Not me. I <i>want</i> 'em to start somethin'! I
want to git a crack at 'em. There's three things
don't go in my camps&mdash;gamblin', booze, an' I.
W. W.'s. I've logged from the State of Maine
to Oregon an' halfways back. I've saw good camps
an' bad ones a-plenty, an' I never seen no trouble
in the woods that couldn't be charged up ag'in'
one of them three."</p>

<p>The train stopped at a little station and Hurley
rose with a yawn. "Guess I'll go have a look at
the horses," he said, and clambered down the
ladder at the end of the car.</p>

<p>The boss did not return when the train moved on
and the boy sat upon the top of the jolting, swaying
box car and watched the ever changing woods
slip southward. Used as he was to the wide open
places, Connie gazed spellbound at the dazzling
brilliance of the autumn foliage. Poplar and birch
woods, flaunting a sea of bright yellow leaves above
white trunks, were interspersed with dark thickets
of scarlet oak and blazing sumac, which in turn
gave place to the dark green sweep of a tamarack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
swamp, or a long stretch of scrubby jack pine. At
frequent intervals squared clearings appeared in
the endless succession of forest growth, where little
groups of cattle browsed in the golden stubble of a
field. A prim, white painted farmhouse, with its
big red barn and its setting of conical grain stacks
would flash past, and again the train would plunge
between the walls of vivid foliage, or roar across
a trestle, or whiz along the shore of a beautiful
land-locked lake whose clear, cold waters sparkled
dazzlingly in the sunlight as the light breeze rippled
its surface.</p>

<p>Every few miles, to the accompaniment of
shrieking brake shoes, the train would slow to a
stop, and rumble onto a siding at some little flat
town, to allow a faster train to hurl past in a rush
of smoke, and dust, and deafening roar, and whistle
screams. Then the wheezy engine would nose out
onto the main track, back into another siding, pick
up a box car or two, spot an empty at the grain
spout of a sagging red-brown elevator, and couple
onto the train again with a jolt that threatened to
bounce the cars from the rails, and caused the imprisoned
horses to stamp and snort nervously.
The conductor would wave his arm and, after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
series of preliminary jerks that threatened to tear
out the drawbars, the train would rumble on its
way.</p>

<p>At one of these stations a longer halt than usual
was made while train crew and lumberjacks
crowded the counter of a slovenly little restaurant
upon whose fly swarming counter doughnuts,
sandwiches, and pies of several kinds reposed beneath
inverted semispherical screens that served
as prisons for innumerable flies.</p>

<p>"The ones that wiggles on yer tongue is flies, an'
the ones that don't is apt to be blueberries," explained
a big lumberjack to Connie as he bit
hugely into a wedge of purplish pie. Connie selected
doughnuts and a bespeckled sandwich
which he managed to wash down with a few mouthfuls
of mud-coloured coffee, upon the surface of
which floated soggy grounds and flakes of soured
milk.</p>

<p>"Flies is healthy," opined the greasy proprietor,
noting the look of disgust with which the boy eyed
the filthy layout.</p>

<p>"I should think they would be. You don't believe
in starving them," answered the boy, and a
roar of laughter went up from the loggers who pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>ceeded
to "kid" the proprietor unmercifully as he
relapsed into surly mutterings about the dire future
in store for "fresh brats."</p>

<p>During the afternoon the poplar and birch woods
and the flaming patches of scarlet oak and sumac,
gave place to the dark green of pines. The farms
became fewer and farther between, and the distance
increased between the little towns, where,
instead of grain elevators, appeared dilapidated
sawmills, whose saws had long lain idle. Mere
ghosts of towns, these, whose day had passed with
the passing of the timber that had been the sole excuse
for their existence. But, towns whose few
remaining inhabitants doggedly clung to their
homes and assured each other with pathetic persistence,
as they grubbed in the sandy soil of their
stump-studded gardens, that with the coming of
the farmers the town would step into its own as the
centre of a wonderfully prosperous agricultural
community. Thus did the residents of each dead
little town believe implicitly in the future of
their own town, and prophesy with jealous vehemence
the absolute decadence of all neighbouring
towns.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the afternoon a boy, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Connie had noticed talking and laughing with the
three lumberjacks Hurley suspected of being I.
W. W.'s, walked along the tops of the swaying cars
and seated himself beside him. Producing paper
and tobacco he turned his back to the wind and
rolled a cigarette, which he lighted, and blew a
cloud of smoke into Connie's face. He was not a
prepossessing boy, with his out-bulging forehead
and stooping shoulders. Apparently he was about
two years Connie's senior.</p>

<p>"Want the makin's?" he snarled, by way of introduction.</p>

<p>"No thanks. I don't smoke."</p>

<p>The other favoured him with a sidewise glance.
"Oh, you don't, hey? My name's Steve Motley,
an' I'm a bear-cat&mdash;<i>me!</i> I'm cookee of this here
camp&mdash;be'n in the woods goin' on two years. Ever
work in the woods?"</p>

<p>Connie shook his head. "No," he answered, "I
never worked in the woods."</p>

<p>"Whatcha done, then? You don't look like no
city kid."</p>

<p>"Why, I've never done much of anything to
speak of&mdash;just knocked around a little."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll knock around some more 'fore you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
git through this winter. We're rough guys, us
lumberjacks is, an' we don't like greeners. I 'spect
though, you'll be runnin' home to yer ma 'fore
snow flies. It gits forty below, an' the snow gits
three foot deep in the woods." Connie seemed
unimpressed by this announcement, and Steve
continued: "They say you're goin' to do the
clerkin' fer the outfit. Hurley, he wanted me to
do the clerkin', but I wouldn't do no clerkin' fer
no man. Keep all them different kind of books
an' git cussed up one side an' down t'other fer
chargin' 'em up with somethin' they claim they
never got out'n the wanagan. Not on yer life&mdash;all
I got to do is help the cook. We're gettin'
clost to Dogfish Spur now, an' the camp's twenty-seven
mile off'n the railroad. Guess you won't
feel lost nor nothin' when you git so far back in the
big sticks, hey?"</p>

<p>Connie smiled. "That's an awfully long ways,"
he admitted.</p>

<p>"You bet it is! An' the woods is full of
wolves an' bears, an' bobcats! If I was figgerin'
on quittin' I'd quit 'fore I got into the
timber."</p>

<p>The train was slowing down, and Steve arose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
"Y'ain't told me yer name, greener! Y'better
learn to be civil amongst us guys."</p>

<p>Connie met the bullying look of the other with a
smile. "My name is Connie Morgan," he said,
quietly, "and, I forgot to mention it, but I did
hold down one job for a year."</p>

<p>"In the woods?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. Over across the line it was."</p>

<p>"Acrost the line&mdash;in Canady? What was <i>you</i>
doin' in Canady?"</p>

<p>"Taming 'bear-cats' for the Government,"
answered the boy, dryly, and rose to his feet just
as Hurley approached, making his way over the
tops of the cars.</p>

<p>"You wait till I git holt of you!" hissed Steve,
scowling. "You think y're awful smart when
y're around in under Hurley's nose. But I'll show
you how us guys handles the boss's pets when he
ain't around." The boy hurried away as Hurley
approached.</p>

<p>"Be'n gittin' in his brag on ye?" grinned the
boss, as his eyes followed the retreating back.
"He's no good&mdash;all mouth. But he's bigger'n
what you be. If he tries to start anything just
lam him over the head with anything that's handy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
He'll leave you be, onct he's found out you mean
business."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess we won't have any trouble," answered
Connie, as he followed Hurley to the
ground.</p>

<span class="smaller">CONNIE TAMES A BEAR-CAT</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="dropleftmax">S</span> the cars came to rest upon the spur, plank
runways were placed in position and the
horses led to the ground and tied to trees. All
hands pitched into the work of unloading. Wagons
appeared and were set up as if by magic as,
under the boss's direction, supplies and equipment
were hustled from the cars.</p>

<p>"You come along with us," said Hurley, indicating
a tote wagon into which men were loading
supplies. "I'm takin' half a dozen of the boys
out tonight to kind of git the camp in shape. It'll
take four or five days to haul this stuff an' you can
help along till the teams start comin', an' then
you've got to check the stuff in. Here's your lists&mdash;supplies
on that one, and equipment on this.
Don't O. K. nothin' till it's in the storehouse or
the cook's camp or wherever it goes to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Connie took the papers and, throwing his turkey
onto the load, climbed up and took his place beside
the men. The teamster cracked his whip and the
four rangy horses started away at a brisk trot.</p>

<p>For five miles or so, as it followed the higher
ground of a hardwood ridge, the road was fairly
good, then it plunged directly into the pines and
after that there was no trotting. Mile after mile
the horses plodded on, the wheels sinking half-way
to the hubs in the soft dry sand, or, in the lower
places, dropping to the axles into chuck holes and
plowing through sticky mud that fell from the
spokes and felloes in great chunks. Creeks were
forded, and swamps crossed on long stretches of
corduroy that threatened momentarily to loosen
every bolt in the wagon. As the team swung from
the hardwood ridge, the men leaped to the ground
and followed on foot. They were a cheerful lot,
always ready to lend a hand in helping the horses
up the hill, or in lifting a wheel from the clutch
of some particularly bad chuck hole. Connie
came in for a share of good-natured banter, that
took the form, for the most part, of speculation
upon how long he would last "hoofing it on shank's
mares," and advice as to how to stick on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
wagon when he should get tired out. The boy answered
all the chafing with a smiling good humour
that won the regard of the rough lumberjacks as
his tramping mile after mile through the sand and
mud without any apparent fatigue won their secret
admiration.</p>

<p>"He's a game un," whispered Saginaw Ed, as
he tramped beside Swede Larson, whose pale blue
eyes rested upon the back of the sturdy little figure
that plodded ahead of them.</p>

<p>"Yah, ay tank hay ban' valk befoor. Hay
ain' drag hees foot lak he gon' for git tire out
queek. Ay bat ju a tollar he mak de camp wit'out
ride."</p>

<p>"You're on," grinned Saginaw, "an', at that,
you got an even break. I can't see he's wobblin'
none yet, an' it's only nine or ten miles to go. I
wished we had that wapple-jawed, cigarette-smokin'
cookee along&mdash;I'd like to see this un show
him up."</p>

<p>"Hay show ham up a'rat&mdash;ju yoost vait."</p>

<p>Twilight deepened and the forest road became
dim with black shadows.</p>

<p>"The moon'll be up directly," observed Hurley,
who was walking beside Connie. "But it don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
give none too much light, nohow, here in the woods.
I've got to go on ahead and pilot."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said the boy, and Hurley
eyed him closely.</p>

<p>"Say, kid, don't let these here jay-hawkers talk
ye inter walkin' yerself to death. They don't like
nawthin' better'n to make a greener live hard.
Let 'em yelp theirself hoarse an' when you git
tuckered jest you climb up beside Frenchy there
an' take it easy. You got to git broke in kind of
slow to start off with an' take good care of yer
feet."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not tired. I like to walk," answered
the boy, and grinned to himself. "Wonder what
he'd think if he knew about some of the trails I've
hit. I guess it would make his little old twenty-mile
hike shrink some."</p>

<p>As they advanced into the timber the road became
worse, and Connie, who had never handled
horses, wondered at the dexterity with which
Frenchy guided the four-horse tote-team among
stumps and chuck holes, and steep pitches. Every
little way it was necessary for Hurley to call a halt,
while the men chopped a log, or a thick mat of
tops from the road. It was nearly midnight when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the team swung into a wide clearing so overgrown
that hardly more than the roofs of the low log
buildings showed above the tops of the brambles
and tall horseweed stalks.</p>

<p>"All right, boys!" called the boss. "We won't
bother to unload only what we need for supper.
Don't start no fire in the big range tonight. Here,
you, Saginaw, you play cook. You can boil a
batch of tea and fry some ham on the office stove&mdash;an'
don't send no more sparks up the stovepipe
than what you need to. If fire got started in these
weeds we'd have two camps to build instead of
one; Swede, you help Frenchy with the horses, an'
yous other fellows fill them lanterns an' git what
you need unloaded an' cover the wagon with a
tarp."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" asked Connie. Hurley eyed
him with a laugh. "Gosh sakes! Ain't you
petered out yet? Well, go ahead and help Saginaw
with the supper&mdash;the can stuff and dishes is
on the hind end of the load."</p>

<p>The following days were busy ones for Connie.
Men and teams laboured over the road, hauling
supplies and equipment from the railway, while
other men attacked the weed-choked clearing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
brush-scythes and mattocks, and made necessary
repairs about the camp. It was the boy's duty to
check all incoming material whether of supplies or
equipment, and between the arrival of teams he
found time to make himself useful in the chinking
of camp buildings and in numerous other ways.</p>

<p>"I'll show you about the books, now," said
Hurley one evening as they sat in the office, or
boss's camp, as the small building that stood off by
itself was called. This room was provided with
two rude pine desks with split log stools. A large
air-tight stove occupied the centre of the floor,
and two double-tier bunks were built against the
wall. The wanagan chests were also ranged along
the log wall into which pins had been inserted for
the hanging of snow-shoes, rifles, and clothing.</p>

<p>The boss took from his desk several books.
"This one," he began, "is the wanagan book. If
a wanagan book is kep' right ye never have no
trouble&mdash;if it ain't ye never have nawthin' else.
Some outfits gouge the men on the wanagan&mdash;I
don't. I don't even add haulin' cost to the price&mdash;they
can git tobacker an' whatever they need jest
as cheap here as what they could in town. But
they've be'n cheated so much with wanagans that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
they expect to be. The best way to keep 'em
from growlin' is to name over the thing an' the
price to 'em after they've bought it, even if it's
only a dime's worth of tobacker. Then jest name
off the total that's ag'in' 'em&mdash;ye can do that by
settin' it down to one side with a pencil each time.
That don't never give them a chanct to kick, an'
they soon find it out. I don't run no 'dollar you
got, dollar you didn't get, an' dollar you ort to got'
outfit. They earn what's comin' to 'em. Some
augers they might as well gouge 'em 'cause they go
an' blow it all in anyhow, soon as they get to
town&mdash;but what's that any of my business? It's
theirn.</p>

<p>"This here book is the time book. Git yer pen,
now, an' I'll call ye off the names an' the wages an'
you can set 'em down." When the task was completed
the boss continued: "Ye know about the
supply book, an' here's the log book&mdash;but ye
won't need that fer a while yit. I've got to cruise
around tomorrow an' find a location fer the new
camp. I want to git it laid out as quick as I can
so the men can git to cuttin' the road through.
Then they can git to work on the buildin's while
I go back an' fill me out a crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wish't you'd slip over to the men's camp an'
tell Saginaw I want to see him. I'll make him
straw boss while I am gone&mdash;the men like him, an'
at the same time they know he won't stand for no
monkey business."</p>

<p>"What's a straw boss?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"He's the boss that's boss when the boss ain't
around," explained Hurley, as Connie put on his
cap and proceeded to the men's camp, a long log
building from whose windows yellow lamplight
shone. The moment he opened the door he was
thankful indeed, that Hurley had invited him to
share the boss's camp. Although the night was not
cold, a fire roared in the huge box stove that occupied
the centre of the long room. A fine drizzle
had set in early in the afternoon, and the drying
racks about the stove were ladened with the rain-dampened
garments of the men. Steam from
these, mingled with the smoke from thirty-odd
pipes and the reek of drying rubbers and socks,
rendered the air of the bunk house thick with an
odorous fog that nearly stifled Connie as he stepped
into the superheated interior.</p>

<p>Seated upon an upper bunk with his feet dangling
over the edge, one of the men was playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
vociferously upon a cheap harmonica, while others
sat about upon rude benches or the edges of bunks
listening or talking. The boy made his way over
the uneven floor, stained with dark splotches of
tobacco juice, toward the farther end of the room,
where Saginaw Ed was helping Frenchy mend a
piece of harness.</p>

<p>As he passed a bunk midway of the room, Steve
rose to his feet and confronted him. "Ha! Here's
the greener kid&mdash;the boss's pet that's too good to
bunk in the men's camp! Whatchu doin' in here?
Did Hurley send you after some strap oil?" As
the two boys stood facing each other in the middle
of the big room the men saw that the cookee was
the taller and the heavier of the two. The harmonica
stopped and the men glanced in grinning
expectation at the two figures. Steve's sneering
laugh sounded startingly loud in the sudden silence.
"He made his brag he used to tame bear-cats
over in Canady!" he said. "Well, I'm a
bear-cat&mdash;come on an' tame me! I'm wild!"
Reaching swiftly the boy jerked the cap from
Connie's head and hurled it across the room where
it lodged in an upper bunk. Some of the men
laughed, but there were others who did not laugh&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>those
who noted the slight paling of the smaller
boy's face and the stiffening of his muscles. With
hardly a glance at Steve, Connie stepped around
him and walked to where Saginaw Ed sat, an
interested spectator of the scene.</p>

<p>"The boss wants to see you in the office," he
said, and turning on his heel, retraced his steps.
Steve stood in the middle of the floor where he
had left him, the sneering smile still upon his lips.</p>

<p>"I believe he's goin' to cry," he taunted, and
again some men laughed.</p>

<p>"What is it you say you are? I don't believe
they all heard you." Again Connie was facing
him, and his voice was steady and very low.</p>

<p>"I'm a bear-cat!"</p>

<p>Connie stretched out his arm: "Give me my
cap, please, I'm in a hurry." The boy seized the
hand roughly, which was just what Connie expected,
and the next instant his other hand closed
about Steve's wrist and quick as a flash he whirled
and bent sharply forward. There was a shrill yelp
of pain as the older boy shot over Connie's lowered
shoulder and struck with a thud upon the uneven
floor. The next instant Connie was astride the
prostrate form and with a hand at his elbow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a><br /><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
another at his wrist, slowly forced the boy's arm
upward between his shoulder blades.</p>

<p>"O-o-o, O-w-w!" howled Steve. "Take him
off! He's killin' me!" Roars of laughter filled
the room as the lumberjacks looked on with shouts
of encouragement and approval. The cookee continued
to howl and beg.</p>

<p>"Once more, now," said Connie, easing up a bit
on the arm. "Tell them what you are."</p>

<p>"Le' me up! Yer broke my arm!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no I didn't." Connie increased the pressure.
"Come on, tell them what you told them a
minute ago. Some of them look as if they don't
believe it."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

<span class="caption">"COME ON, TELL THEM WHAT YOU TOLD THEM A MINUTE AGO"</span>
</div>

<p>"O-w-w, I'm a-a bear-cat&mdash;O-w-w!" whimpered
the boy, with such a shame-faced expression
that the men roared with delight.</p>

<p>Connie rose to his feet. "Climb up there and
get my cap, and bring it down and hand it to me,"
he ordered tersely. "And the next time you feel
wild, just let me know."</p>

<p>For only an instant the boy looked into the blue-grey
eyes that regarded him steadily and then
sullenly, without a word, he stepped onto the
lower bunk, groped for a moment in the upper one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and handed Connie his cap. A moment later the
boy, accompanied by Saginaw Ed, stepped out into
the night, but Saginaw saw what Connie did not&mdash;the
look of crafty malevolence that flashed into
Steve's eyes as they followed the departing pair.</p>

<p>"By jiminetty, kid, y're all right!" approved
the man, as they walked toward the office. "That
was as handy a piece of work as I ever seen, an'
they ain't a man in camp'll fergit it. You're there!
But keep yer eye on that cookee&mdash;he's a bad egg.
Them kind can't take a lickin' like a man. He'll
lay fer to git even, if it takes him all winter&mdash;not so
much fer what you done to him as where you done
it&mdash;with the men all lookin' on. They never will
quit raggin' him with his bear-cat stuff&mdash;an' he
knows it."</p>

<span class="smaller">HURLEY LAYS OUT THE NEW CAMP</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="dropleftmid">ANT</span> to go 'long?" asked Hurley, the
morning after the "bear-cat" incident, as
he and Connie were returning to the office from
breakfast at the cook's camp. "I've got to locate
the new camp an' then we'll blaze her out an'
blaze the road so Saginaw can keep the men
goin'." The boy eagerly assented, and a few
moments later they started, Hurley carrying an
axe, and Connie with a light hand-axe thrust into
his belt. Turning north, they followed the river.
It was slow travelling, for it was necessary to
explore every ravine in search of a spot where a
road crossing could be effected without building a
bridge. The spot located, Hurley would blaze
a tree and they would strike out for the next
ravine.</p>

<p>"It ain't like we had to build a log road,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
explained the boss, as he blazed a point that, to
Connie, looked like an impossible crossing. "Each
camp will have its own rollways an' all we need is a
tote road between 'em. Frenchy Lamar can put
a team anywhere a cat will go. He's the best
hand with horses on the job, if he is a jumper."</p>

<p>"What's a jumper?" asked Connie.</p>

<p>"You'll find that out fast enough. Jumpin'
a man generally means a fight in the woods&mdash;an' I
don't blame 'em none, neither. If I was a jumper
an' a man jumped me, he'd have me to lick afterwards&mdash;an'
if any one jumps a jumper into hittin'
me, he'll have me to lick, too."</p>

<p>When they had proceeded for four or five miles
Hurley turned again toward the river and for two
hours or more studied the ground minutely for a
desirable location for the new camp. Up and
down the bank, and back into the woods he paced,
noting in his mind every detail of the lay of the
land. "Here'd be the best place for the camp
if it wasn't fer that there sand bar that might
raise thunder when we come to bust out the rollways,"
he explained, as they sat down to eat their
lunch at midday. "There ain't no good rollway
ground for a half a mile below the bar&mdash;an' they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
ain't no use makin' the men walk any furthur'n
what they have to 'specially at night when they've
put in a hard day's work. We'll drop back an'
lay her out below&mdash;it ain't quite as level, but it'll
save time an' a lot of man-power."</p>

<p>As Connie ate his lunch he puzzled mightily
over Hurley. He had journeyed from far off
Alaska for the purpose of bringing to justice a
man who had swindled him and his partner out of
thousands of dollars worth of timber. His experience
with the Mounted had taught him that,
with the possible exception of Notorious Bishop
whose consummate nerve had commanded the
respect even of the officers whose business it was
to hunt him down, law-breakers were men who
possessed few if any admirable qualities. Yet
here was a man who, Connie was forced to admit,
possessed many such qualities. His first concern
seemed to be for the comfort of his men, and
his orders regarding the keeping of the wanagan
book showed that it was his intention to deal with
them fairly. His attitude toward the despicable
I. W. W.'s was the attitude that the boy knew
would have been taken by any of the big men of
the North whose rugged standards he had un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>consciously
adopted as his own. He, himself,
had been treated by the boss with a bluff friendliness&mdash;and
he knew that, despite Hurley's blustering
gruffness, the men, with few exceptions, liked
him. The boy frankly admitted that had he not
known Hurley to be a crook he too would have
liked him.</p>

<p>Luncheon over, the boss arose and lighted his
pipe: "Well, 'spose we just drop back an' lay out
the camp, then on the way home we'll line up the
road an' take some of the kinks out of it an'
Saginaw can jump the men into it tomorrow
mornin'." They had proceeded but a short
distance when the man pointed to a track in the
softer ground of a low swale: "Deer passed here
this mornin'," he observed. "The season opens
next week, an' I expect I won't be back with the
crew in time for the fun. If you'd like to try yer
hand at it, yer welcome to my rifle. I'll dig you
out some shells tonight if you remind me to."</p>

<p>"I believe I will have a try at 'em," said Connie,
as he examined the tracks; "there were two deer&mdash;a
doe, and a half-grown fawn, and there was a
<i>loup-cervier</i> following them&mdash;that's why they
were hitting for the river."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Hurley stared at the boy in open-mouthed
astonishment: "Looky here, kid, I thought you
said you never worked in the woods before!"</p>

<p>Connie smiled: "I never have, but I've
hunted some, up across the line."</p>

<p>"I guess you've hunted <i>some</i>, all right,"
observed the boss, drily; "I wondered how it
come you wasn't petered out that night we come
into the woods. Wherever you've hunted ain't
none of my business. When a man's goin' good,
I b'lieve in tellin' him so&mdash;same's I b'lieve in
tellin' him good an' plain when he ain't. You've
made a good start. Saginaw told me about
what you done to that mouthy cookee. That
was all right, fer as it went. If I'd be'n you I'd
a punched his face fer him when I had him down
'til he hollered' 'nough'&mdash;but if you wanted to let
him off that hain't none of my business&mdash;jest you
keep yer eye on him, that's all&mdash;he's dirty.
Guess I didn't make no mistake puttin' you in
fer clerk&mdash;you've learnt to keep yer eyes open&mdash;that's
the main thing, an' mebbe it'll stand you
good 'fore this winter's over. There's more'n
I. W. W.'s is the matter with this camp&mdash;" The
boss stopped abruptly and, eyeing the boy sharply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
repeated his warning of a few days before:
"Keep yer mouth shet. There's me, an' Saginaw,
an' Lon Camden&mdash;he'll be the scaler, an' whoever
bosses Number Two Camp&mdash;Slue Foot Magee, if
I can git holt of him. He was my straw-boss
last year. If you've got anythin' to say, say it to
us. Don't never tell nothin' to nobody else about
nothin' that's any 'count&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"You can depend on me for that," answered
the boy, and Hurley picked up his axe.</p>

<p>"Come on, le's git that camp laid out. We
won't git nothin' done if we stand 'round gassin'
all day." The two followed down the river to
the point indicated by Hurley where the banks
sloped steeply to the water's edge, well below the
long shallow bar that divided the current of
the river into two channels. As they tramped
through the timber Connie puzzled over the
words of the boss. Well he knew that there was
something wrong in camp beside the I. W. W.'s.
But why should Hurley speak of it to him? And
why should he be pleased at the boy's habit of
observation? "Maybe he thinks I'll throw in
with him on the deal," he thought: "Well, he's
got an awful jolt coming to him if he does&mdash;but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
things couldn't have broken better for me, at
that."</p>

<p>At the top of the steep bank Hurley blazed
some trees, and with a heavy black pencil, printed
the letter R in the centre of the flat, white scars.
"That'll show 'em where to clear fer the rollways,"
he explained, then, striking straight back
from the river for about twenty rods, he blazed a
large tree. Turning at right angles, he proceeded
about twenty five rods parallel with the river
bank and made a similar blaze. "That gives 'em
the corners fer the clearin', an' now fer spottin'
the buildin's." Back and forth over the ground
went the man, pausing now and then to blaze a
tree and mark it with the initial of the building
whose site it marked. "We don't have to corner
these," he explained, "Saginaw knows how big
to build 'em&mdash;the trees marks their centre." The
sun hung low when the task was completed.
"You strike out for the head of the nearest ravine,"
said Hurley, "an' when you come to the tree we
blazed comin' up, you holler. Then I'll blaze
the tote road to you, an' you can slip on to the
next one. Straighten her out as much as you can
by holdin' away from the short ravines." Connie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
was surprised at the rapidity with which Hurley
followed, pausing every few yards to scar a tree
with a single blow of his axe.</p>

<p>The work was completed in the dark and as
they emerged onto the clearing Hurley again
regarded the boy with approval: "You done
fine, kid. They's plenty of older hands than you
be, that would of had trouble locatin' them blazes
in the night, but you lined right out to 'em like
you was follerin' a string. Come on, we'll go
wash up an' see what the cook's got fer us."</p>

<p>After supper Saginaw Ed received his final
instructions, and early next morning Hurley struck
out on foot fer Dogfish Spur. "So long, kid,"
he called from the office door. "I left the shells
on top of my desk an' yonder hangs the rifle. I
was goin' to give you a few pointers, but from what
I seen yeste'day, I don't guess you need none
about huntin'. I might be back in a week an'
it might be two 'cordin' to how long it takes me
to pick up a crew. I've got some men waitin' on
me, but I'll have to rustle up the balance wherever
I can git 'em. I told Saginaw he better move
his turkey over here while I'm gone. You'll find
Saginaw a rough-bark piece of timber&mdash;but he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
sound clean plumb through to the heart, an' if
you don't know it now, before this winter's over
yer goin' to find out that them's the kind to tie to&mdash;when
you kin find 'em."</p>

<p>Connie gazed after the broad-shouldered form
'til it disappeared from sight around a bend of the
tote road, then he turned to his books with a
puzzled expression. "Either Mike Gillum was
wrong, or Hurley's the biggest bluffer that ever
lived," he muttered, "and which ever way it is
I'll know by spring."</p>

<p>Saginaw put his whole crew at work on the
tote road. Saplings and brush were cleared away
and thrown to the side. Trees were felled, the
larger ones to be banked on the skidways and
later hauled to the rollways to await the spring
break-up, and the smaller ones to be collected
and hauled to the new camp for building material.</p>

<p>Connie's duties were very light and he spent
much time upon the new tote road watching the
men with whom he had become a great favourite.
Tiring of that, he would take long tramps through
the woods and along the banks of the numerous
little lakes that besprinkled the country, searching
for sign, so that, when the deer season opened he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
would not have to hunt at random, but could
stalk his game at the watering places.</p>

<p>"Whar's yer gun, sonny?" called out a lanky
sawyer as the boy started upon one of these
excursions.</p>

<p>"Hay ain' need no gun," drawled Swede Larson,
with a prodigious wink that distorted one whole
side of his face. "Ay tank he gon fer hont some
bear-cat." And the laughter that followed told
Connie as he proceeded on his way, that his
handling of Steve had met the universal approval
of the crew.</p>

<p>It was upon his return from this expedition that
the boy witnessed an actual demonstration of
the effect of sudden suggestion upon a jumper.
Frenchy Lamar pulled his team to the side of the
roadway and drew his watch from his pocket.
At the same time, Pierce, one of the I. W. W. suspects,
slipped up behind him and bringing the flat
of his hand down upon Frenchy's shoulder, cried:
"<i>throw it</i>." Frenchy threw it, and the watch
dropped with a jangle of glass and useless wheels
at the foot of a tree. The next instant Frenchy
whirled upon his tormentor with a snarl. The
man, who had no stomach for an open fight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
turned to run but the Frenchman was too quick
for him. The other two I. W. W.'s started to
their pal's assistance but were halted abruptly,
and none too gently by other members of the
crew. "Fight!" "Fight!" The cry was taken
up by those nearby and all within hearing rushed
gleefully to the spot. The teamster was popular
among the men and he fought amid cries of advice
and encouragement: "Soak 'im good, Frenchy!"
"Don't let 'im holler ''nough' till he's down!"</p>

<p>The combat was short, but very decisive.
Many years' experience in the lumber woods had
taught Frenchy the art of self-defence by force
of fist&mdash;not, perhaps, the most exalted form of
asserting a right nor of avenging a wrong&mdash;but,
in the rougher walks of life, the most thoroughly
practical, and the most honourable. So, when the
teamster returned to his horses a few minutes
later, it was to leave Pierce whimpering upon
the ground nursing a badly swollen and rapidly
purpling eye, the while he muttered incoherent
threats of dire vengeance.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="dropleftmin">HANGED</span> yer job?" inquired Saginaw Ed,
sleepily a few mornings later when Connie
slipped quietly from his bunk and lighted the oil
lamp.</p>

<p>"Not yet," smiled the boy. "Why?"</p>

<p>"No one but teamsters gits up at this time of
night&mdash;you got an hour to sleep yet."</p>

<p>"This is the first day of the season, and I'm
going out and get a deer."</p>

<p>Saginaw laughed: "Oh, yer goin' out an' git a
deer&mdash;jest like rollin' off a log! You might's well
crawl back in bed an' wait fer a snow. Deer
huntin' without snow is like fishin' without bait&mdash;you
might snag onto one, but the chances is all
again' it."</p>

<p>"Bet I'll kill a deer before I get back," laughed
the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Better pack up yer turkey an' fix to stay a
long time then," twitted Saginaw. "But, I won't
bet&mdash;it would be like stealin'&mdash;an' besides, I lost
one bet on you a'ready."</p>

<p>The teamsters, their lanterns swinging, were
straggling toward the stable as the boy crossed
the clearing.</p>

<p>"Hey, w'at you gon keel, de bear-cat?" called
Frenchy.</p>

<p>"Deer," answered Connie with a grin.</p>

<p>"Ho! She ain' no good for hont de deer! She
too mooch no snow. De groun' she too mooch
dry. De deer, she hear you comin' wan mile too
queek, den she ron way ver' fas', an' you no kin
track heem."</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," parried the boy,
"I'll be in tonight, and in the morning you can
go out and help me pack in the meat."</p>

<p>"A'm help you breeng in de meat, a'ri. Ba
Goss! A'm lak A'm git to bite me on chonk dat
<i>venaison</i>."</p>

<p>Connie proceeded as rapidly as the darkness
would permit to the shore of a marshy lake some
three or four miles from camp, and secreted himself
behind a windfall, thirty yards from the trail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
made by the deer in going down to drink. Just
at daybreak a slight sound attracted his attention,
and peering through the screen of tangled branches,
the boy saw a large doe picking her way cautiously
down the trail. He watched in silence as she
advanced, halted, sniffed the air suspiciously, and
passed on to the water's edge. Lowering her head,
she rubbed an inquisitive nose upon the surface
of the thin ice that sealed the shallow bay of the
little lake. A red tongue darted out and licked
at the ice and she pawed daintily at it with a
small front foot. Then, raising the foot, she brought
it sharply down, and the knifelike hoof cut through
the ice as though it were paper. Pleased with
the performance she pawed again and again,
throwing the cold water in every direction and
seeming to find great delight in crushing the ice
into the tiniest fragments. Tiring of this, she
paused and sniffed the air, turning her big ears
backward and forward to catch the slightest
sound that might mean danger. Then, she drank
her fill, made her way back up the trail, and
disappeared into the timber. A short time later
another, smaller doe followed by a spring fawn,
went down, and allowing them to pass unharmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Connie settled himself to wait for worthier game.
An hour passed during which the boy ate part of
the liberal lunch with which the cook had provided
him. Just as he had about given up hope of seeing
any further game, a sharp crackling of twigs
sounded directly before him, and a beautiful
five-prong buck broke into the trail and stood
with uplifted head and nostrils a-quiver. Without
taking his eyes from the buck, Connie reached
for his rifle, but just as he raised it from the
ground its barrel came in contact with a dry branch
which snapped with a sound that rang in the boy's
ears like the report of a cannon. With a peculiar
whistling snort of fear, the buck turned and
bounded crashing away through the undergrowth.
Connie lowered the rifle whose sights had been
trained upon the white "flag" that bobbed up
and down until it was lost in the thick timber.</p>

<p>"No use taking a chance shot," he muttered,
disgustedly. "If I should hit him I would only
wound him, and I couldn't track him down without
snow. I sure am glad nobody was along to see
that, or they never would have quit joshing me
about it." Shouldering his rifle he proceeded
leisurely toward another lake where he had spotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a water-trail, and throwing himself down behind
a fallen log, slept for several hours. When he
awoke the sun was well into the west and he
finished his lunch and made ready to wait for his
deer, taking good care this time that no twig or
branch should interfere with the free use of his gun.</p>

<p>At sunset a four-prong buck made his way
cautiously down the trail and, waiting 'til the
animal came into full view, Connie rested his
rifle across the log and fired at a point just behind
the shoulder. It was a clean shot, straight
through the heart, and it was but the work of a
few moments to bleed, and draw him. Although
not a large buck, Connie found that it was more
than he could do to hang him clear of the wolves,
so he resorted to the simple expedient of peeling
a few saplings and laying them across the carcass.
This method is always safe where game or meat
must be left exposed for a night or two, as the
prowlers fear a trap. However, familiarity breeds
contempt, and if left too long, some animal is
almost sure to discover the ruse.</p>

<p>Packing the heart, liver, and tongue, Connie
struck out swiftly for camp, but darkness overtook
him with a mile still to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>As he approached the clearing a low sound
caused him to stop short. He listened and again
he heard it distinctly&mdash;the sound of something
heavy moving through the woods. The sounds
grew momentarily more distinct&mdash;whatever it
was was approaching the spot where he stood.
A small, thick windfall lay near him, and beside
it a large spruce spread its low branches invitingly
near the ground. With hardly a sound Connie,
pack, gun, and all, scrambled up among those
thick branches and seated himself close to the
trunk. The sounds drew nearer, and the boy
could hear fragments of low-voiced conversation.
The night prowlers were men, not animals! Connie's
interest increased. There seemed to be
several of them, but how many the boy could not
make out in the darkness. Presently the leader
crashed heavily into the windfall where he floundered
for a moment in the darkness.</p>

<p>"This is fer enough. Stick it in under here!"
he growled, as the others came up with him.
Connie heard sounds as of a heavy object being
pushed beneath the interlaced branches of the
windfall but try as he would he could not catch a
glimpse of it. Suddenly the faces of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
showed vividly as one of their number held a
match to the bowl of his pipe. They were the
three I. W. W.'s and with them was Steve! "Put
out that match you eediot! D'ye want the hull
camp a pokin' their nose in our business?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't no one kin see way out here,"
growled the other, whom Connie recognized as
Pierce.</p>

<p>"It's allus fellers like you that knows more'n
any one else, that don't know nawthin'," retorted
the first speaker, "come on, now, we got to git
back. Remember&mdash;'leven o'clock on the furst
night the wind blows stiff from the west. You,
Steve, you tend to swipin' Frenchy's lantern.
Pierce here, he'll soak the straw, an' Sam, you
stand ready to drive a plug in the lock when I
come out. Then when the excitement's runnin'
high, I'll holler that Frenchy's lantern's missin'
an' they'll think he left it lit in the stable. I tell
ye, we'll terrorize every business in these here
United States. We'll have 'em all down on their
knees to the I. W. W.! Then we'll see who's the
bosses an' the rich! We'll hinder the work, an'
make it cost 'em money, an' Pierce here'll git
even with Frenchy, all in one clatter. We'll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
gittin' back, now. An' don't all pile into the
men's camp to onct, neither."</p>

<p>Connie sat motionless upon his branch until
the sounds of the retreating men were lost in
the darkness. What did it all mean? "Swipe
Frenchy's lantern." "Plug the lock." "Soak
the straw." "Terrorize business." The words
of the man repeated themselves over and over in
Connie's brain. What was this thing these men
were planning to do "at eleven o'clock the first
night the wind blows stiff from the west?" He
wriggled to the ground and crept toward the thing
the men had <i>cached</i> in the windfall. It was a
five-gallon can of coal-oil! "That's Steve's part
of the scheme, whatever it is," he muttered.
"He's got a key to the storehouse." Leaving
the can undisturbed, he struck out for camp,
splashing through the waters of a small creek
without noticing it, so busy was his brain trying
to fathom the plan of the gang. "I've got all day
tomorrow, at least," he said, "and that'll give
me time to think. I won't tell even Saginaw
'til I've got it doped out. I bet when they try to
start something they'll find out who's going to be
terrorized!" A few minutes later he entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
office and was greeted vociferously by Saginaw
Ed:</p>

<p>"Hello there, son, by jiminetty, I thought you'd
took me serious when I told you you'd better
make a long stay of it. What ye got there? Well,
dog my cats, if you didn't up an' git you a deer!
Slip over to the cook's camp an' wade into some
grub. I told him to shove yer supper onto the
back of the range, again' you got back. While yer
gone I'll jest run a couple rags through yer rifle."</p>

<p>When Connie returned from the cook's camp
Saginaw was squinting down the barrel of the
gun. "Shines like a streak of silver," he announced;
"Hurley's mighty pernickety about his
rifle, an' believe me, it ain't everyone he'd borrow
it to. Tell me 'bout yer hunt," urged the man,
and Connie saw a gleam of laughter in his eye.
"Killed yer deer dead centre at seven hundred
yards, runnin' like greased lightnin', an' the
underbrush so thick you couldn't hardly see yer
sights, I 'pose."</p>

<p>The boy laughed: "I got him dead centre, all
right, but it was a standing shot at about twenty
yards, and I had a rest. He's only a four-prong&mdash;I
let a five-prong get away because I was clumsy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Saginaw Ed eyed the boy quizzically: "Say,
kid," he drawled. "Do you know where folks
goes that tells the truth about huntin'?"</p>

<p>"No," grinned Connie.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't neither," replied Saginaw,
solemnly. "I guess there ain't no place be'n
pervided, but if they has, I bet it's gosh-awful
lonesome there."</p>

<p>Despite the volubility of his companion, Connie
was unusually silent during the short interval
that elapsed before they turned in. Over and
over in his mind ran the words of the four men out
there in the dark, as he tried to figure out their
scheme from the fragmentary bits of conversation
that had reached his ears.</p>

<p>"Don't mope 'cause you let one buck git away,
kid. Gosh sakes, the last buck I kilt, I got so
plumb rattled when I come onto him, I missed
him eight foot!"</p>

<p>"How did you kill him then?" asked Connie,
and the instant the words were spoken he realized
he had swallowed the bait&mdash;hook and all.</p>

<p>With vast solemnity, Saginaw stared straight
before him: "Well, you see, it was the last shell
in my rifle an' I didn't have none in my pocket, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
I throw'd the gun down an' snuck up an' bit him
on the lip. If ever you run onto a deer an' ain't
got no gun, jest you sneak up in front of him an'
bite him on the lip, an' he's yourn. I don't know
no other place you kin bite a deer an' kill him.
They're like old Acolyte, or whatever his name
was, in the Bible, which they couldn't kill him 'til
they shot him in the heel&mdash;jest one heel, mind you,
that his ma held him up by when she dipped him
into the kettle of bullet-proof. If he'd of be'n
me, you bet I'd of beat it for the Doc an' had that
leg cut off below the knee, an' a wooden one made,
an' he'd of be'n goin' yet! I know a feller's got
two wooden ones, with shoes on 'em jest like other
folks, and when you see him walk the worst you'd
think: he's got a couple of corns."</p>

<p>"Much obliged, Saginaw," said Connie, with the
utmost gravity, as he arose and made ready for
bed, "I'll sure remember that. Anyhow you
don't need to worry about any solitary confinement
in the place where the deer hunters go."
And long after he was supposed to be asleep, the
boy grinned to himself at the sounds of suppressed
chuckling that came from Saginaw's bunk.</p>

<p>Next morning Connie helped Frenchy pack in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the deer, and when the teamster had returned to
his work, the boy took a stroll about camp. "Let's
see," he mused, "they're going to soak the straw
inside the stable with oil and set fire to it on the
inside, and they'll do it with Frenchy's lantern
so everyone will think he forgot it and it got tipped
over by accident. Then, before the fire is discovered
they'll lock the stable and jam the lock
so the men can't get in to fight it." The boy's
teeth gritted savagely. "And there are sixteen
horses in that stable!" he cried. "The dirty
hounds! A west wind would sweep the flames
against the oat house, then the men's camp, and
the cook's camp and storehouse. They sure do
figure on a clean sweep of this camp. But, what
I can't see is how that is going to put any one in
terror of the I. W. W., if they think Frenchy
caused the fire accidentally. Dan McKeever
says all crooks are fools&mdash;and he's right." He
went to the office and sat for a long time at his
pine desk. From his turkey he extracted the
Service revolver that he had been allowed to keep
in memory of his year with the Mounted. "I can
take this," he muttered, as he affectionately
twirled the smoothly running cylinder with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
thumb, "and Saginaw can take the rifle, and we
can nail 'em as they come out of the woods with
the coal-oil can. The trouble is, we wouldn't
have anything on them except maybe the theft of
a little coal-oil. I know what they intend to do,
but I can't prove it&mdash;there's four of them and
only one of me and no evidence to back me up.
On the other hand, if we let them start the fire,
it might be too late to put it out." His eyes
rested on the can that contained the supply of oil
for the office. It was an exact duplicate of the
one beneath the windfall. He jumped to his feet
and crossing to the window carefully scanned
the clearing. No one was in sight, and the boy
passed out the door and slipped silently into the
thick woods. When he returned the crew was
crowding into the men's camp to wash up for
supper. The wind had risen, and as Connie's
gaze centred upon the lashing pine tops, he
smiled grimly,&mdash;it was blowing stiffly from the
west.</p>

<p>After supper Saginaw Ed listened with bulging
eyes to what the boy had to say. When he was
through the man eyed him critically:</p>

<p>"Listen to me, kid. Nonsense is nonsense, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
business is business. I don't want no truck with
a man that ain't got some nonsense about him
somewheres&mdash;an' I don't want no truck with one
that mixes up nonsense an' serious business. Yer
only a kid, an' mebbe you ain't grabbed that yet.
But I want to tell you right here an' now, fer yer
own good: If this here yarn is some gag you've
rigged up to git even with me fer last night, it's a
mighty bad one. A joke is a joke only so long as
it don't harm no one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Every word I've told you is the truth," broke
in the boy, hotly.</p>

<p>"There, now, don't git excited, kid. I allowed
it was, but they ain't no harm ever comes of
makin' sure. It's eight o'clock now, s'pose we
jest loaf over to the men's camp an' lay this here
case before 'em."</p>

<p>"No! No!" cried the boy: "Why, they&mdash;they
might kill them!"</p>

<p>"Well, I 'spect they would do somethin' of the
kind. Kin you blame 'em when you stop to think
of them horses locked in a blazin' stable, an' the
deliberate waitin' 'til the wind was right to carry
the fire to the men's camp? The men works
hard, an' by eleven o'clock they're poundin' their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ear mighty solid. S'pose they didn't wake up
till too late&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>Connie shuddered. In his heart he felt, with
Saginaw Ed, that any summary punishment the
men chose to deal out to the plotters would be
richly deserved. "I know," he replied: "But,
mob punishment is never <i>right</i>, when a case can be
reached by the law. It may look right, and lots
of times it does hand out a sort of rough justice.
But, here we are not out of reach of the law, and
it will go lots farther in showing up the I. W. W.
if we let the law take its course."</p>

<p>Saginaw Ed seemed impressed: "That's right,
kid, in the main. But there ain't no law that will
fit this here special case. S'pose we go over an'
arrest them hounds&mdash;what have we got on 'em!
They swiped five gallons of coal-oil! That would
git 'em mebbe thirty days in the county jail.
The law can't reach a man fer what he's <i>goin'</i> to
do&mdash;an' I ain't a goin' over to the men's camp an'
advise the boys to lay abed an' git roasted so's
mebbe we kin git them I. W. W.'s hung. The
play wouldn't be pop'lar."</p>

<p>Connie grinned: "Well, not exactly," he
agreed. "But, why not just sit here and let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
go ahead with their scheme. I've got a good
revolver, and you can take the rifle, and we can
wait for 'em in the tote wagon that's just opposite
the stable door. Then when they've soaked the
straw, and tipped over Frenchy's lantern, and
locked the door behind 'em, and plugged the lock,
we can cover 'em and gather 'em in."</p>

<p>"Yeh, an' meanwhile the fire'll be workin' on
that oil-soaked straw inside, an' where'll the horses
be? With this here wind a blowin' they ain't men
enough in the woods to put out a fire, an' the hull
camp would go."</p>

<p>Connie laughed, and leaning forward, spoke
rapidly for several moments. When he had
finished, Saginaw eyed him with undisguised
approval: "Well, by jiminetty! Say, kid, you've
got a head on you! That's jest the ticket! The
courts of this State has jest begun to wake up to
the fact that the I. W. W. is a real danger. A
few cases, with the evidence as clean again' 'em
as this, an' the stinkin' varmints 'll be huntin'
their holes&mdash;you bet!"</p>

<p>At nine-thirty Saginaw and Connie put out the
office light, and with some clothing arranged
dummies in their bunks, so that if any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
conspirators should seek to spy upon them through
the window they would find nothing to arouse
their suspicion. Then, fully armed, they crept
out and concealed themselves in the tote wagon.
An hour passed, and through the slits cut in the tarpaulin
that covered them, they saw four shadowy
forms steal silently toward them from the direction
of the men's camp. Avoiding even the
feeble light of the stars, they paused in the shadow
of the oat house, at a point not thirty feet from
the tote wagon. A whispered conversation ensued
and two of the men hastily crossed the open
and disappeared into the timber.</p>

<p>"Stand still, can't ye!" hissed one of those who
remained, and his companion ceased to pace nervously
up and down in the shadow.</p>

<p>"I'm scairt," faltered the other, whom the
watchers identified as Steve. "I wisht I wasn't
in on this."</p>

<p>"Quit yer shiverin'! Yer makin' that lantern
rattle. What they do to us, if they ketch us,
hain't a patchin' to what we'll do to you if you
back out." The man called Sam spat out his
words in an angry whisper, and the two relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of a half-hour the two men who had
entered the timber appeared before the door of
the stable, bearing the oil can between them.
The others quickly joined them, there was a
fumbling at the lock, the door swung open, and
three of the men entered. The fourth stood ready
with the heavy padlock in his hand. A few
moments of silence followed, and then the sound
of the empty can thrown to the floor. A feeble
flicker of flame dimly lighted the interior, and
the three men who had entered rushed out into
the night. The heavy door closed, the padlock
snapped shut and a wooden plug was driven into
the key hole.</p>

<p>"<i>Hands up!</i>" The words roared from the
lips of Saginaw Ed, as he and Connie leaped
to the ground and confronted the four at a
distance of ten yards. For one terrified instant
the men stared at the guns in their
captors hands, and then four pairs of hands flew
skyward.</p>

<p>"Face the wall, an' keep a reachin'," commanded
Saginaw, "an' if any one of you goes to start
somethin' they'll be wolf-bait in camp in about
one second."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>A horse snorted nervously inside the stable and
there was a stamping of iron shod feet.</p>

<p>"Jest slip in an' fetch out Frenchy's lantern,
kid, an' we'll git these birds locked up in the oat
house, 'fore the men gits onto the racket."</p>

<p>With a light crow-bar which the boy had brought
for the purpose, he pryed the hasp and staple
from the door, leaving the plugged lock for evidence.
Entering the stable whose interior was
feebly illumined by the sickly flare of the overturned
lantern, he returned in time to hear the
petty bickering of the prisoners.</p>

<p>"It's your fault," whined Pierce, addressing
the leader of the gang. "You figgered out this
play&mdash;an' it hain't worked!"</p>

<p>"It hain't neither my fault!" flashed the man.
"Some one of you's blabbed, an' we're in a pretty
fix, now."</p>

<p>"'Twasn't me!" came in a chorus from the
others.</p>

<p>"But at that," sneered Sam, "if you'd a lit
that oil, we'd a burnt up the camp anyhow."</p>

<p>"I did light it!" screamed the leader, his face
livid with rage. "I tipped over the lantern an'
shoved it right under the straw."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right," grinned Connie, from the doorway,
as he flashed the lantern upon the faces of
the men. "And if you hadn't taken the trouble
to soak the straw with water it would have burned,
too."</p>

<p>"Water! Whad' ye mean&mdash;water?"</p>

<p>"I mean just this," answered the boy, eyeing the
men with a glance of supreme contempt, "I sat
out there beside that windfall last night when you
hid your can of oil. I listened to all you had to
say, and today I slipped over there and poured
out the oil and filled the can with water. You
I. W. W.'s are a fine outfit," he sneered: "If
you had some brains, and nerve, and consciences,
you might almost pass for <i>men!</i>"</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PRISONERS</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">"I</span> WISH'T Hurley was here," said Saginaw Ed,
as he and Connie returned to the boss's camp
after locking the prisoners in the oat house.
"The men's goin' to want to know what them four
is locked up fer. If we don't tell 'em there'll be
trouble. They don't like them birds none but,
at that, they won't stand fer 'em bein' grabbed
an' locked up without nothin' ag'in' 'em. An' on
the other hand, if we do tell 'em there's goin' to
be trouble. Like as not they'd overrule me an'
you an' hunt up a handy tree an' take 'em out an'
jiggle 'em on the down end of a tight one."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we slip 'em down to the nearest jail
and tell the men about it afterwards, or send for a
constable or sheriff to come up here and get
them?"</p>

<p>Saginaw shook his head: "No. If me an' you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
was to take 'em down the camp would blow up in
no time. When the men woke up an' found the
boss, an' the clerk, an' three hands, an' the cookee
missin', an' the lock pried offen the stable door,
work would stop right there. There ain't nothin'
like a myst'ry of some kind to bust up a crew of
men. We couldn't wake no one else up to take
'em without we woke up the whole men's camp,
an' they'd want to know what was the rookus.
If we sent fer a constable it'd be two or three
days 'fore he'd git here an' then it would be too
late. This here thing's comin' to a head when
them teamsters goes fer the oats in the mornin',
an' I've got to be there when they do."</p>

<p>"I hate to see Steve mixed up in this. He's
only a kid. I wonder if there isn't some way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Saginaw Ed interrupted him roughly: "No.
There ain't no way whatever. He's a bad aig or
he wouldn't do what he done. You're only a kid,
too, but I take notice you ain't throw'd in with no
such outfit as them is."</p>

<p>"I can't help thinking maybe he's getting a
wrong start&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's got a wrong start, all right. But he
got it quite a while ago&mdash;this here kind of busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>ness
ain't no startin' job. They're all of a piece,
kid. It's best we jest let the tail go with the
hide."</p>

<p>"What will Hurley do about it? If he agrees
with us, won't the men overrule him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what he'll do&mdash;I only wish't he
was here to do it. But, as fer as overrulin' him
goes&mdash;" Saginaw paused and eyed Connie solemnly,
"jest you make it a p'int to be in the same township
sometime when a crew of men ondertakes to
overrule Hurley. Believe me, they'd have the
same kind of luck if they ondertook to overrule
Mont Veesooverus when she'd started in to erup'."</p>

<p>The door swung open and Hurley himself stood
blinking in the lamplight. "This here's a purty
time fer workin' men to be up!" he grinned.
"Don't yous lads know it's half past twelve an'
you'd orter be'n asleep four hours?"</p>

<p>"I don't hear <i>you</i> snorin' none," grinned Saginaw.
"An' you kin bet me an' the kid sure is
glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Got through sooner'n I expected. Slue Foot
had the crew all picked out. He'll bring 'em in
from the Spur in the mornin'. Thought I'd jest
hike on out an' see how things was gittin' on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we're gittin' on, all right. Tote road's all
cleared, Camp Two's clearin's all ready, an' the
buildin's most done. An' besides that, four
prisoners in the oat house, an' me an' the kid,
here, losin' sleep over what to do with 'em."</p>

<p>"Prisoners! What do you mean&mdash;prisoners?"</p>

<p>"Them I. W. W.'s an' that cookee that throw'd
in with 'em. They tried to burn the outfit&mdash;locked
the hosses in the stable an' set fire to it,
after waitin' 'til the wind was so it would spread
over the hull camp."</p>

<p>Hurley reached for a peavy that stood in
the corner behind the door. "Ye say they
burn't thim harses?" he rasped, in the brogue
that always accompanied moments of anger or
excitement.</p>

<p>"No they didn't, but they would of an' it
hadn't be'n fer the kid, here. He outguessed 'em,
an' filled their coal-oil can with water, an' then we
let 'em go ahead an' put on the whole show so
we'd have 'em with the goods."</p>

<p>The big boss leaned upon his peavy and regarded
Connie thoughtfully. "As long as I've got a
camp, kid, you've got a job." He bit off a huge
chew of tobacco and returned the plug to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
pocket, after which he began deliberately to roll
up his shirt sleeves. He spat upon the palms of
his hands, and as he gripped the peavy the muscles
of his huge forearm stood out like steel cables.
"Jist toss me th' key to th' oat house," he said
in a voice that rumbled deep in his throat.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Connie's hand was upon the boss's arm.
"Sit down a minute and let's talk it over&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure, boss," seconded Saginaw. "Let's have
a powwow. If you go out there an' git to workin'
on them hounds with that there peavy you're
liable to git excited an' tap 'em a little harder'n
what you intended to, an' then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hurley interrupted with a growl and the two
saw that his little eyes blazed. "Oi ain't got the
strength to hit 'em har-rder thin Oi intind to!
An-ny one that 'ud thry to bur-rn up harses&mdash;let
alone min slaypin' in their bunks, they can't no
man livin' hit 'em har-rd enough wid an-nything
that's made."</p>

<p>"I know," agreed Saginaw. "They ain't nothin'
you could do to 'em that they wouldn't still
have some a-comin'. But the idee is this: Bein'
misclassed as humans, them I. W. W.'s is felonious
to kill. Chances is, the grand jury would turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
you loose when they'd heard the facts, but the
grand jury don't set 'til spring, an' meantime,
where'd you be? An' where'd this camp be?
Your contract calls fer gittin' out logs, an' don't
stipulate none whatever about spatterin' up the
oat house with I. W. W.'s. I don't like to spoil
a man's fun, but when a mere frolic, that way,
interferes with the work, as good a man as you be
is a-goin' to put it off a spell. You know, an' I
know, there's more than gittin' out logs to this
winter's work."</p>

<p>Saginaw's words evidently carried weight with
Hurley. The muscles of the mighty arms relaxed
and the angry gleam faded from his eyes. Also,
the brogue was gone from his voice; nevertheless,
his tone was ponderously sarcastic as he asked:
"An' what is it you'd have me to do, seein' ye're
so free with yer advice&mdash;pay 'em overtime fer the
night work they done tryin' to burn up my camp?"</p>

<p>Saginaw grinned: "The kid's got it doped out
about right. He figgers that it'll show 'em up
better if we let the courts handle the case an'
convict 'em regular. With what we've got on
'em they ain't no chanct but what they'll get
convicted, all right."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see," broke in Connie, "the I. W. W.'s
are a law-defying organization. The only way to
bring them to time is to let the law do it. As soon
as <i>all</i> the I. W. W.'s see that the law is stronger
than they are, and that their lawless acts are sure
to be punished, there won't be any more I. W. W.'s.
The law can't teach them this unless it has the
chance. Of course, if the law had had the chance
and had fallen down on the job because the men
behind it were cowardly, it would be time enough
to think about other ways. But, you told me
yourself that Minnesota was beginning to give 'em
what's coming to 'em, and she'll never get a better
chance to hand 'em a jolt than this is, because
we've got 'em with the goods. Now, if we'd go to
work and let the men at 'em, or if you'd wade
into 'em yourself we wouldn't be smashing at the
I. W. W.'s, but only at these three men. When
you stop to think of it, you can't teach an outfit
to respect the law when you go ahead and break
the law in teaching 'em."</p>

<p>Hurley seemed much impressed. "That stands
to reason," he agreed. "You're right, kid, an'
so's Saginaw. I know Judge McGivern&mdash;used to
go to school with him way back&mdash;he ain't much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
as fer as size goes but believe me he ain't afraid to
hand these birds a wallop that'll keep 'em peekin'
out between black ones fer many a day to come.
I'll take 'em down myself, an' then I'll slip around
an' have a talk with Mac." Hurley tossed the
peavy into its corner and proceeded to unlace his
boots.</p>

<p>"I kind of hate to see Steve go along with that
bunch. He ain't a regular I. W. W., and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boss looked up in surprise as a heavy boot
thudded upon the floor. "What d'ye mean&mdash;hate
to see?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, he might turn out all right, if we kept
him on the job and kind of looked after him."</p>

<p>The boss snorted contemptuously. "Huh! He
done you dirt onct didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He throw'd in with these here ornery scum
that ain't neither men, fish, nor potatoes, didn't
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Yes' is all right&mdash;an' they ain't no 'buts'
about it. I had him last winter, an' he wasn't no
'count. I thought they might be some good in
him so I hired him ag'in this fall to give him an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>other
chanct, but he's rotten-hearted an' twisty-grained,
an' from root to top-branch they ain't
the worth of a lath in his hide. He's a natural-borned
crook. If it was only hisself I wouldn't
mind it, but a crook is dangerous to other folks&mdash;not
to hisself. It ain't right to leave him loose."
The other boot thudded upon the floor and Hurley
leaned back in his chair, stretched out his legs
and regarded the toes of his woollen socks. "I've
often thought," he continued, after a moment of
silence, "that men is oncommon like timber.
There's the select, straight-grained, sound stuff,
an' all the grades down through the culls 'til you
come to the dozy, crooked, rotten-hearted stuff
that ain't even fit to burn. There's sound stuff
that's rough-barked an' ugly; an' there's rotten-hearted
stuff that looks good from the outside.
There's some timber an' some men that's built to
take on a high polish&mdash;don't know as I kin git it
acrost to you jest like I mean&mdash;but bankers and
pianos is like that. Then there's the stuff that's
equal as sound an' true but it wouldn't never take
no polish on account its bein' rough-grained an'
tough-fibred&mdash;that's the kind that's picked to
carry on the world's heavy work&mdash;the kind that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
goes into bridges an' ships, an' the frames of
buildin's. It's the backbone, you might say, of
civilization. It ain't purty, but its work ain't
purty neither&mdash;it jest does what it's picked to do.</p>

<p>"It's cur'us how fer you kin carry it on if yer a
mind to. There's some good timber an' some
good men that's started bad but ain't got there
yet. The bad habits men take on is like surface
rot, an' weather checks, an' bug stings&mdash;take that
stuff an' put it through the mill an' rip it an' plane
it down to itself, an' it's as good as the best&mdash;sometimes.
The danger to that kind is not puttin'
it through the mill quick enough, an' the rot strikes
through to the heart.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of timber that there ain't much
expected of&mdash;an' a lot of humans, too. They're
the stuff that works up into rough boards, an' cull
stuff, an' lath, an' pulp wood, an' cordwood an'
the like of that&mdash;an' so it goes, folks an' timber
runnin' about alike.</p>

<p>"It takes experience an' judgment to sort
timber, jest like it takes experience an' judgment
to pick men. But no matter how much experience
an' judgment he's got, as long as <i>man's</i> got
the sortin' to do, mistakes will be made. Then, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
long time afterwards, somewheres somethin' goes
wrong. They can't no one account fer it, nor
explain it&mdash;but the Big Inspector&mdash;he knows."</p>

<p>Hurley ceased speaking, and Connie, who had
followed every word, broke in: "Couldn't we
keep Steve here and&mdash;put him through the mill?"</p>

<p>The boss shook his head: "No&mdash;we didn't
catch him young enough. I'm responsible, in a
way, fer the men in this camp. This here runt
has showed he don't care what he does&mdash;s'pose he
took a notion to slip somethin' into the grub&mdash;what
then? Keepin' him in this camp would be
like if I seen a rattlesnake in the bunk house an'
walked off an' left it there."</p>

<p>Connie realized that any further effort on his
part to save Steve from sharing the richly deserved
fate of the I. W. W.'s would be useless. The
three turned in and it seemed to the boy that he
had barely closed his eyes when he was awakened
by the sounds of someone moving about the room.
Hurley and Saginaw Ed were pulling on their
clothes as the boy tumbled out of bed.</p>

<p>"You don't need to git up yet, kid. Me an'
Saginaw's goin' to slip out an' see that the teamsters
gits their oats without lettin' no I. W. W.'s trickle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
out the door. Better pound yer ear fer an hour
yet, cause you're goin' to be busier'n a pet coon
checkin' in Slue Foot's supplies, an' gittin' his men
down on the pay roll."</p>

<p>As Connie entered the cook's camp for breakfast
he noticed an undercurrent of unrest and suppressed
excitement among the men who stood
about in small groups and engaged in low-voiced
conversation. Hurley and Saginaw Ed were already
seated, and, as the men filed silently in, many
a sidewise glance was slanted toward the big boss.</p>

<p>When all were in their places Hurley rose from
his chair. "We've got three I. W. W.'s an' the
cookee locked up in the oat house," he announced
bluntly. "An' after breakfast me an' Frenchy
is goin' to take 'em down to jail." There was a
stir among the men, and Hurley paused, but no
one ventured a comment. "They tried to burn
the stable last night, but the kid, here, outguessed
'em, an' him an' Saginaw gathered 'em in."</p>

<p>"Last night!" cried a big sawyer, seated half-way
down the table. "If they'd a-burnt the
stable last night the whole camp would of gone!
Let us boys take 'em off yer hands, boss, an' save
you a trip to town."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea gained instant approval among the
men, and from all parts of the room voices were
raised in assent.</p>

<p>"Over in Westconsin we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hurley interrupted the speaker with a grin:
"Yeh, an' if we was over in Westconsin I'd say
go to it! But Minnesota's woke up to these here
varmints&mdash;an' it's up to us to give her a chanct to
show these here other States how to do it. You
boys all know Judge McGivern&mdash;most of you
helped elect him. Give him the chanct to hand
the I. W. W.'s a wallop in the name of the State of
Minnesota! If the State don't grab these birds,
they'll grab the State. Look at North Dakota!
It ain't a State no more&mdash;it's a Non-partisan
League! Do you boys want to see Minnesota an
I. W. W. Lodge?"</p>

<p>As Hurley roared out the words his huge fist
banged the table with a force that set the heavy
porcelain dishes a-clatter.</p>

<p>"No! No!" cried a chorus of voices from
all sides. "The boss is right! Let the State
handle 'em!" The men swung unanimously to
Hurley and the boss sat down amid roars of
approval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>And so it was that shortly after breakfast
Frenchy cracked his whip with a great flourish
and four very dejected-looking prisoners started
down the tote road securely roped to the rear of
the tote wagon, at the end gate of which sat
Hurley, rifle in hand and legs a-dangle as he
puffed contentedly at his short black pipe.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>




<h2 class="subhead"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />

<span class="smaller">THE BOSS OF CAMP TWO</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">LUE FOOT MAGEE</span>, who was to boss Camp
Two, was a man of ambling gait and a
chronic grumble. He arrived with the vanguard
of the new crew a half-hour before dinner time,
grumbled because grub wasn't ready, growled
when he learned that the buildings at Camp Two
were not entirely completed, and fumed because
Hurley had told him to leave fifteen of his fifty
men at Camp One.</p>

<p>"What's the use of pickin' out a crew an' then
scatterin' 'em all over the woods?" he demanded
querulously of Connie, as they stood in the door
of the boss's camp while the men washed up for
dinner. "If Hurley wants thirty-five men in
Camp Two an' fifty in Camp One why don't he
send Camp One's crew up to Two an' leave me
have Camp One?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," answered the boy, and refrained
from mentioning that he was mighty glad Hurley
had not ordered it so.</p>

<p>Slue Foot slanted him a keen glance. "Be
you the kid Hurley was tellin' nailed them I. W.
W.'s that he was fetchin' out of the woods when
we come in this mornin'?"</p>

<p>Connie nodded: "Yes, Saginaw Ed and I
caught 'em."</p>

<p>"Purty smart kid, hain't you? What's Hurley
payin' you?"</p>

<p>"Forty dollars a month."</p>

<p>"An' no rake-off on the wanagan. There's
plenty room in the woods to use brains&mdash;same as
anywheres else." Slue Foot turned at the sound
of the dinner gong. "Let's go eat while there's
some left. When we come back I'll give you the
names."</p>

<p>During the meal Connie furtively studied the
new boss. He was fully as large as Hurley, and
slovenly in movement and appearance. His restless
eyes darted swift glances here, there, and
everywhere, and never a glance but registered
something of disapproval. But it was the man's
words that most interested the boy. Why had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
he asked what Hurley was paying him? And
what did he mean by his observation that there
was no rake-off on the wanagan? Also, there was
his reference to the fact that in the woods there
was plenty of room for brains. That might mean
anything or nothing.</p>

<p>"At any rate," thought the boy, as he attacked
his food, "you're going to be a pretty good man to
throw in with&mdash;for a while."</p>

<p>Presently the man pushed back his bench and
arose: "If you ever git that holler in under yer
ribs filled up we'll go over an' I'll give you the
names of the men that stays here an' the ones that
goes on with me."</p>

<p>"'Lead on, MacDuff,'" grinned Connie, misquoting
a line from a play Waseche Bill had taken
him to see in Fairbanks.</p>

<p>"Magee's my name," corrected the man gruffly,
and led the way to the office.</p>

<p>It was only after much deliberation and growling
that Slue Foot finally succeeded in rearranging
his crew, but at last the task was completed and
Connie leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"So you think there ain't going to be any rake-off
on the wanagan?" he asked, as the man sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
scowling at his list of names. Slue Foot glanced
up quickly and the boy met the glance with a
wink: "I thought maybe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It don't make no difference what you thought
mebbe!" the man interrupted. "If you know'd
Hurley like I do you'd know a whole lot better'n
to try it." Connie looked disappointed and the
boss eyed him intently.</p>

<p>"They's other ways of killin' a cat without you
choke him to death on butter," he observed
drily, and lapsed into silence while the restless
gimlet eyes seemed to bore into the boy's very
thoughts.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man brought his fist down with a
bang upon the top of the pine desk: "Why
should Hurley be drawin' down his big money,
an' me an' you our seventy-five an' forty a
month?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, he's the boss, and they say he can get
out the logs."</p>

<p>"I'm a boss, too! An' I kin git out the logs!"
he roared. "I was bossin' camps when Hurley
was swampin'." Again he paused and regarded
the boy shrewdly. "Mind you, I hain't sayin'
Hurley hain't a good logger, 'cause he is. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
jest between me and you there's a hull lot about
this here timber game that he hain't hep to. Any
one kin draw down wages workin' in the woods&mdash;but
if you want to make a real stake out of the
game you've got to learn how to play both ends
ag'in' the middle. An' that's where the brains
comes in."</p>

<p>"That's why I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;you could soak it to 'em on the wanagan
an' shove the rake-off in your pocket," finished
the man. "Well, you'd better fergit it! Some
bosses would stand fer it, but not Hurley. He'd
tumble to yer game in a minute, an' you'd be
hikin' down the tote road with yer turkey on yer
back a-huntin' a new job."</p>

<p>"Do you mean there's nothing in it for me
but my forty dollars a month?" asked Connie,
with apparent disgust.</p>

<p>"M-m-m-m, well, that depends," muttered
Slue Foot. "Be you goin' to keep the log book,
or Hurley?"</p>

<p>"I am. He told me the other day he'd show
me about that later."</p>

<p>"They'll be a little somethin', mebbe, in shadin'
the cut when the time comes&mdash;nothin' big, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
enough to double our wages. Wait 'til the crew
gits strung out an' layin' 'em down an' we'll fix
that up."</p>

<p>"Will the scaler throw in with us?" ventured
the boy.</p>

<p>"What! Lon Camden! Not on yer life, he
won't! Hurley picked him, an' he picked Saginaw
Ed, too. What you an' me do we got to do alone."</p>

<p>Connie smiled: "Yes, but he picked you, and
he picked me, too."</p>

<p>"He did," agreed the other, with a leer. "I
don't know nawthin' about why he picked you,
but he give me a job 'cause he thinks I done him a
good turn onct. Over in Idaho, it was, an' we
was gittin' out logs on the Fieldin' slope. Old
Man Fieldin' had a contrac' which if he didn't
fill it by a certain day, he'd lose it, an' the Donahue
crowd that was operatin' further down would
deliver their logs an' take over the contrac'.
That's when I got it in fer Hurley. Him an'
me was working fer Fieldin' an' he made Hurley
boss of a camp he'd ort to give to me.</p>

<p>"The Donahue crowd worked politics an' got
holt of the water rights on Elk Creek, an' Fieldin'
couldn't float his logs. It looked like it was good-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>night
fer Fieldin' an' his contrac' but Hurley
grabbed all the men he could git holt of an' started
buildin' a flume. Old Man Fieldin' said it couldn't
be done, but fer Hurley to go ahead, 'cause he
was ruint anyhow. So Hurley worked us night
and day, an' by gosh, he built the flume an' got
his logs a-runnin'!</p>

<p>"When the flume was up the Donahues seen
they was beat, so they come to me an' offered me
a bunch of coin if I'd blow it up. It was resky
'cause Hurley was expectin' some such play, an'
he had it guarded. But I got on guardin' nights
an' I planted the dynamite and got the wires
strung, an' it was all set. Then I went an' overplayed
my hand. I thought I seen the chanct to
git even with Hurley, as well as Old Man Fieldin',
an' make me a nice little stake besides. So I tips
it off to Hurley that I seen a fellow sneakin'
around suspicious an' he'd better take the shift
where I'd be'n, hisself. You see, I made it up
with the Donahues to send three of their men over
to explode the shot so I'd have a alibi, an' I figgered
that Hurley'd run onto 'em, an' they'd give him
an' awful lickin'." The man paused and crammed
tobacco into his pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"And did he?" asked Connie, eagerly</p>

<p>"Naw, he didn't he!" growled the man. "He
run onto 'em all right&mdash;an' when the rookus was
over the hull three of 'em was took to the horspital.
When it comes to mixin' it up, Hurley, he's there.
He found the dynamite, too, an' after that the
guards was so thick along that flume that one
couldn't do nawthin' without the next ones could
see what he was up to.</p>

<p>"Fieldin's logs was delivered on time an' the
old man handed Hurley a check fer twenty-five
hundred dollars over an' above his wages. Hurley
slipped me five hundred fer tellin' him&mdash;but I'd
of got five thousan' if I'd of blow'd up the flume.
I had to skip the country 'fore them three got out
of the horspital, an' I've swore to git even with
Hurley ever since&mdash;an' I'll do it too. One more
winter like last winter, an' they won't no outfit
have him fer a boss."</p>

<p>It was with difficulty Connie refrained from
asking what had happened last winter but he was
afraid of arousing the man's suspicion by becoming
too inquisitive, so he frowned: "That's all right
as far as your getting even with Hurley, but it
don't get me anything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Slue Foot leaned forward in his chair: "I see
you've got yer eye on the main chanct, an' that
shows you've got somethin' in your noodle. Folks
can talk all they want to, but the only thing that's
any good is money. Them that's got it is all
right, an' them that hain't got it is nowhere.
Take Hurley, he's got the chanct to make his
everlastin' stake right here, an' he's passin' it
up. The owner of this here trac' lives up in Alaska
or somewheres, an' he hain't a loggin' man nohow&mdash;an'
here Hurley would set and let him git rich&mdash;offen
Hurley's work, mind you&mdash;an' all Hurley
gits out of it is his wages. An' if you throw in
with him you'll go out in the spring with yer forty
dollars a month minus yer wanagan tab."</p>

<p>"Guess that's right," agreed the boy. "I'd
like to make a lot of money, but it looks like there's
nothin' doing in this camp."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied the man. "I'm
a-goin' to git mine, an' the way things is, I kin
use a party about your size that kin keep his eyes
open and his mouth shet. Looks like, from here,
they might be considerable in it fer you, long about
spring." He paused and glanced about the
office. "You sleep in here don't you?" Connie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
nodded, and Slue Foot seemed satisfied, "I kin
use you, 'cause you're right here on the job where
you kin keep tab on the boss, an' Saginaw, an'
Lon Camden." The man paused abruptly and
peered through the window.</p>

<p>"What's the game?" asked Connie boldly.
"I can't do any good going it blind."</p>

<p>The man silenced him with a gesture: "Shet
up! Here comes Saginaw. That'll keep 'til
later. Meanwhile, it don't pay fer me an' you
to seem none too friendly. When any one's
around I'll kick an' growl about the books and you
sass me back." He rose from his chair and was
stamping about the room when Saginaw entered.</p>

<p>"Here it's took a good hour to git them names
down that any one with half sense had ort to got
down in fifteen minutes! If you can't check in
them supplies no quicker'n what you kin write
down names, the grub will rot before we git it
onloaded. Come on, we'll go up to the camp
an' git at it."</p>

<p>The man turned to greet the newcomer. "Hello
Saginaw! I hear you're a boss now. Well, good
luck to you. How's the new camp, 'bout ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a couple of days will finish her up. Yer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
storehouse an' men's camp, an' cook's camp is
done, so you can go ahead an' move in."</p>

<p>Slue Foot scowled: "I seen Hurley comin'
out an' he says I should leave you fifteen men
out of my crew, so I done it. Seems funny he'd
give a green boss the biggest crew, but he's got
you right here where he kin keep his eye on you,
so I s'pose he knows what he's doin'."</p>

<p>"I 'spect he does," agreed Saginaw. "When
you git to camp send them men back with mine."</p>

<p>Slue Foot nodded. "Well come on, kid," he
ordered, gruffly. "We'll go up on the tote wagon."</p>

<p>Connie picked up his book and followed, and
as he went out the door he turned to see Saginaw
regarding him curiously.</p>

<span class="smaller">SAGINAW ED IN THE TOILS</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="dropleftmin">ONNIE</span> hoped that during the ride to Camp
Two Slue Foot would further enlighten him
concerning his various schemes for defrauding
his employers, but the man sat silent, eyeing
the tall pines that flanked the roadway on either
side.</p>

<p>"Pretty good timber, isn't it?" ventured the
boy, after a time.</p>

<p>The boss nodded: "They hain't much of them
kind left. If I owned this trac' an' could afford
to pay taxes I'd never lay down a stick of it fer
ten year&mdash;mebbe twenty."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why not! 'Cause it'll be worth ten dollars
where it's worth a dollar now&mdash;that's why. Pine's
a-goin' up every year, an' they've cut the best of
it everywheres except here an' there a strip that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
fer one reason an' another they couldn't git holt
of."</p>

<p>"The Syndicate's cutting theirs now, and surely
they can afford to pay taxes."</p>

<p>Slue Foot grinned: "They wouldn't be cuttin'
their white pine along Dogfish if this trac' wasn't
bein' cut."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Mebbe if you kind of stick around, like I told
you, you'll see. I'm one of these here hairpins
that never tells no one nawthin' about anythin'
'til the time comes&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"You're all right, Slue Foot," laughed the boy.
"I guess I'll stick around."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing fer you you got sense enough
to know who to tie to. No one never made nawthin'
workin' fer wages&mdash;an' no one ever will."</p>

<p>As they drew into Camp Two's clearing Slue
Foot cocked a weatherwise eye skyward. "Shouldn't
wonder an' the snow'll be comin' tonight or
tomorrow&mdash;them clouds looks like it. Come on,
le's git at them supplies. They's two wagons in
a'ready an' two more comin' an' we want to git
'em onloaded by night."</p>

<p>Slue Foot called a dozen men to help with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
unloading and stowing, and for the rest of the
afternoon Connie had his hands full checking off
the goods as they were carried past him at the
door. At last the task was completed and after
supper the boy struck out for Camp One. As he
plodded through the jet blackness of the tote
road his mind was busy with the problem that confronted
him. What should he do? Manifestly the
easiest course would be to go straight to Hurley and
tell him just what Slue Foot had told him, and let
the boss deal with him as he saw fit. But, in that
case Hurley would, in all probability, fly off the
handle and either discharge Slue Foot or "beat him
up" or both. In which event the man would go
unpunished for last winter's work, whatever that
had been, and worst of all, there would be absolutely
no evidence against the Syndicate. And
he had no intention of pocketing last year's loss
without at least an attempt to recover it and
bring its perpetrators to justice.</p>

<p>From what he had seen of Hurley, and what
Saginaw and Slue Foot had told him, the boy was
confident that the big boss was square and honest
as the day is long&mdash;but there was Mike Gillum,
himself an honest man and a friend of Waseche,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
who had reported that Hurley was in the pay of
the Syndicate; and Connie knew that men like
Mike Gillum did not lie about other men, nor
would they make an open accusation unless reasonably
sure of their ground. Therefore there
was a bare possibility that, despite all evidence to
the contrary, Hurley, unknown to either Slue Foot
or Saginaw, was playing into the hand of the
Syndicate.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's the matter with Saginaw,"
muttered the boy as he stumbled on through the
darkness. "He looked at me kind of funny when
we left the office. As if he knows Slue Foot is
crooked, and thinks I have thrown in with him."
His fists clenched and his lips drew into a hard,
straight line. "I'll get to the bottom of it if it
takes all winter!" he gritted. "And when I do,
someone is going to squirm." Something prickled
sharply against his cheek and he glanced upward.
He could see nothing in the inky blackness, but
the prickling sensation was repeated and he knew
that it was snowing. The wind rose and the
snow fell faster. By the time he reached the clearing
it whitened the ground. The little office was
dark as he let himself in. The sound of heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
breathing told him that Saginaw was already in
bed, and, without lighting the lamp, he undressed
and crawled between his blankets.</p>

<p>When Connie awoke the following morning
the fire was burning brightly in the stove and
Saginaw stood staring out through the little window
that showed a translucent grey square against
the dark log wall. He turned at the sound of the
boy's feet upon the floor. "Snow's held off fer a
long time this year, but when she come she come
a-plenty," he observed.</p>

<p>"Still snowing?" asked the boy, as he wriggled
into his clothing. "It started last night while
I was coming down from Camp Two."</p>

<p>"Yeh, it's still snowin.' Foot deep a'ready an'
comin' down in fine flakes an' slantin' like she's
a-goin' to keep on snowin'!"</p>

<p>"Are you going to begin laying 'em down today?"</p>

<p>Saginaw shook his head: "No. I'm a-goin'
to set 'em overhaulin' the sleds, an' the sprinkler,
an' the drays, an' gittin' the skidways in shape,
an' breakin' out the road. It's cold enough fer
to make a good bottom an' things ort to go a-whoopin'
when this snow lets up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Connie snickered. "I bet Slue Foot's growling
this morning, with no roof on his office and blacksmith
shop, and his stable and oat house only
about half chinked."</p>

<p>"He'd growl if his camp was 'lectric lit an'
steam het. I'm ready fer breakfast, if the cook's
saved us some. You go on over an' I'll be 'long
when I git the men strung out." Saginaw filled
the stove with chunks and together they left the
office, the older man heading for the men's camp,
while Connie made directly for the cook's camp.
As the boy lowered his head to the sting of
the sweeping snow and plodded across the
clearing, a feeling of great loneliness came over
him, for he knew that there lurked in the man's
mind a feeling of distrust&mdash;a feeling that he had
studiously attempted to conceal. Nothing in the
spoken words revealed this distrust, but the boy
was quick to note that the voice lacked something
of the hearty comradery that had grown up
between them.</p>

<p>"This is almost like Alaska," Connie muttered,
as he breathed deeply of the clean, cold air. "I
wish I was in Ten Bow right now&mdash;with Waseche
Bill, and MacDougall, and Dutch Henry and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
rest of 'em&mdash;or else over on the Yukon with Big
Dan McKeever, and Rickey." The boy's fists
clenched within his mittens, as was their habit
when he faced a difficult situation. "If it wasn't
that Waseche is depending on me to straighten
out this mess, I'd strike out for Ten Bow today.
But I've just naturally got to see it through&mdash;and
I've got to go it alone, too. If I should let Saginaw
in, and it should turn out that Hurley is
crooked, my chance of nailing him would be shot,
because Saginaw and Hurley are one, two, three.</p>

<p>"The first thing I better do," he decided, as he
stamped the snow from his boots before the door
of the cook's camp, "is to slip up and see Mike
Gillum and find out how he knows Hurley is in
the pay of the Syndicate."</p>

<p>During the breakfast the boy was unusually
silent and when the meal was finished he returned
directly to the office, and stood for a long time
staring out into the whirling white smother. As
he turned to his desk his eye encountered Hurley's
snow-shoes hanging from their peg on the opposite
wall. "It's only ten miles to Willow River," he
muttered, "and I've just got to see Mike Gillum."</p>

<p>A moment later he stepped through the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fastened on the snow-shoes and, hastening across
the clearing, plunged into the timber.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when Saginaw Ed returned
to the office and found it empty. Almost instantly
he noticed that the boss's snow-shoes were missing
and he grinned: "Kid's out practising on the
rackets, I guess." Then he stepped to the door.
The snow had continued to fall steadily&mdash;fine,
wind-driven flakes that pile up slowly. The trail
was very faint, and as the man's eye followed it
across the clearing his brows drew into a puzzled
frown. "That don't look like no practice trail,"
he muttered. "No, sir! They ain't no greener
ever yet started off like that." He pinched his
chin between his thumb and forefinger and scowled
at the trail. "One of two things: Either the
kid ain't the greener he lets on to be, or else someone
else has hiked off on the boss's snow-shoes.
An' either which way, it's up to me to find out."
Crossing swiftly to the cook shack he returned a
few minutes later, the pockets of his mackinaw
bulging with lunch, and drawing his own snow-shoes
from beneath his bunk, struck out upon the
fast dimming trail.</p>

<p>"I mistrust Slue Foot, an' I didn't like the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
he started to bawl out the kid yeste'day. It
seemed kind of like it wasn't straight goods. He's
a beefer an' a growler, all right, but somehow, this
time it seemed as if it was kind of piled on fer my
special benefit."</p>

<p>In the timber, sheltered from the sweep of the
wind, the track had not drifted full, but threaded
the woods in a broad, trough-like depression that
the woodsman easily followed. Mile after mile
it held to the north, dipping into deep ravines,
skirting thick windfalls, and crossing steep ridges.
As the trail lengthened the man's face hardened.
"Whoever's a-hikin' ahead of me ain't no greener
an' he ain't walkin' fer fun, neither. He's travellin'
as fast as I be, an' he knows where he's a-goin',
too." He paused at the top of a high ridge and
smote a heavily mittened palm with a mittened
fist. "So that's the way of it, eh? I heard how
the Syndicate was runnin' a big camp on Willow
River&mdash;an' this here's the Willow River divide.
They ain't only one answer, the kid, or whoever
it is I'm a-follerin', has be'n put in here by the
Syndicate to keep cases on Hurley's camps&mdash;either
that, or Slue Foot's in with 'em, an' is usin'
the kid fer a go-between. They're pretty smart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
all right, headin' way up to this here Willow River
camp. They figgered that no one wouldn't pay
no 'tention to a trail headin' north, while if it led
over to the Syndicate camp on Dogfish someone
would spot it in a minute. An' with it snowin'
like this, they figgered the trail would drift full,
or else look so old no one would bother about
it. They ain't only one thing to do, an' that's
to go ahead an' find out. What a man knows
is worth a heap more'n what he can guess. They's
a-goin' to be some big surprises on Dogfish 'fore
this winter's over, an' some folks is a-goin' to
wish they'd of be'n smarter&mdash;or stayed honester."</p>

<p>Saginaw descended the slope and, still following
the trail, walked steadily for an hour. Suddenly
he paused to listen. Distinctly to his ears came
the measured thud of pounded iron, punctuated
at regular intervals by the metallic ring of a hammer
upon an anvil. "It's the Syndicate's Willow
River camp," he muttered, and advanced cautiously.
Presently he gained the clearing and,
skirting it, halted at the edge of a log road that
reached back into the timber. The man noted
that whoever made the trail had made no attempt
to conceal his visit from the Syndicate crew, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the tracks struck into the road which led directly
into the clearing. Not a soul was in sight and,
hurriedly crossing the road, Saginaw continued
to skirt the clearing until he arrived at a point
directly opposite a small building that stood by
itself midway between the men's camp and the
stable. "That had ort to be the office," he said
as he studied the lay of the camp and the conformation
of the ground. Several large piles of
tops lay between the edge of the clearing and the
small building, against the back of which had
been placed a huge pile of firewood. Across the
clearing upon the bank of the river a crew of men
were engaged in levelling off the rollways, and
other men were busy about the open door of the
blacksmith shop, where the forge fire burned
brightly. The storm had thinned to a scarcely
perceptible downfall and the rising wind whipped
the smoke from the stovepipe of the building.
"I've got to find out who's in that office," he
decided and, suiting the action to the word, moved
swiftly from one pile of tops to another, until he
gained the shelter of the woodpile.</p>

<p>It is a very risky thing to peer into the window
of a small room occupied by at least two people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in broad daylight, and it was with the utmost
caution that Saginaw removed his cap and applied
his eye to the extreme corner of the pane. Seated
facing each other, close beside the stove, were
Connie and Mike Gillum. The boss's hand was
upon the boy's knee and he was talking earnestly.
At the sight Saginaw could scarce refrain from
venting his anger in words. He had seen enough
and, dodging quickly back, retraced his steps,
and once more gained the shelter of the timber.</p>

<p>"So that's yer game, is it, you sneakin' little
spy? Takin' advantage of Hurley the minute his
back's turned! You've got him fooled, all right.
An' you had me fooled, too. You're a smart kid,
but you ain't quite smart enough. You can't
do no harm now we're onto yer game, an' 'fore
them logs hits the water in the spring yer goin'
to find out you ain't the only smart one in the
timber&mdash;you an' Slue Foot, too."</p>

<p>It was well past the middle of the afternoon
when Saginaw took the back trail and struck out
at a long swinging walk for the camp on Dogfish.
The flash of anger, engendered by the sight of
the boy in friendly conference with the boss of the
Syndicate camp, gave way to keen disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
as he tramped on and on through the timber.
He had liked Connie from the first, and as the
days went by his regard for the boy, whose brains
and nerve had won the respect and admiration of
the whole camp, grew. "I've a good mind to git
him off to one side an' give him a good straight
talk. He ain't like that Steve. Why, doggone
it! I couldn't feel no worse about findin' out he's
headed wrong, if he was my own boy. An' if he
was my own boy, it would be my job to talk
things over with him an' try to steer him straight,
instead of layin' for to catch him in some crooked
work an' send him over the road for it. By gum,
I'll do it, too! An' I'll give it to him right straight,
without no fancy trimmin's neither. Tonight'll be
a good time when him an' I'll be alone."</p>

<p>His cogitations had carried him to within a mile
of Camp Two, which the trail carefully avoided,
when suddenly, at the bottom of a deep ravine,
a man stepped in front of him:</p>

<p>"Hands up!" It was some seconds before
Saginaw realized that he was staring straight into
the muzzle of a rifle that the man held within six
inches of his nose. Two other men stepped from
behind trees and joined the leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Makes a difference which end of the gun yer
at when ye hear them words, don't it?" sneered
the man, and in the deep twilight of the thick woods
Saginaw recognized the men as the three I. W. W.'s
that he and Connie had arrested in their attempt
to burn the stable. Also he recognized the boss's
rifle.</p>

<p>"Where's Hurley?" he cried, as full realization
of the situation forced itself upon him.</p>

<p>"I said <i>'hands up'!</i>" reminded the man with
the gun, "an' I meant it. An' if I wus you I'd
put 'em up. I guess when we git through with
ye ye'll think twict before ye lock folks up in a
oat house to freeze to death all night&mdash;you an'
that smart alec kid."</p>

<p>"Where's Hurley?" repeated Saginaw, with
arms upraised.</p>

<p>The man laughed, coarsely: "Hurley, we fixed
his clock fer him. An' we'll fix yourn, too. We'll
learn ye to fool with the I. W. W. when it's a-goin'
about its business. An' we'll learn everyone else,
too. We're stronger 'n the law, an' stronger 'n
the Government, an' when we git ready we'll show
the bosses an' the capitalists where to git off at!"</p>

<p>"You're a bunch of dirty crooks, an' thieves, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
murderers&mdash;an' you ain't got the brains to show
nobody nawthin'."</p>

<p>"Search him!" commanded the leader, his face
livid with rage. "We'll show you somethin',
'fore we git through with you&mdash;jest like we showed
Hurley. Come on, now, git a move on. We got
to see a party an' git holt of some grub. 'Fore we
git started, though, ye kin jest take off them
snow-shoes, I kin use 'em myself, an' you kin see
how it feels to waller through the snow like we
be'n doin'." The transfer was soon accomplished,
and marching Saginaw before them, the
three headed off at a right angle from the trail.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="dropleftmin">ONNIE MORGAN</span> halted abruptly and
stared down at the snow. At the point
where, a couple of hours before, he had emerged
into the tote road, another, fresher, snow-shoe
track crossed the road and struck out upon his
back trail. For some moments he studied the
track, his trained eye taking every slightest detail.
"Whoever it was followed my trail to here, and
for some reason didn't want to follow it on into
the clearing. So he kept on, and it wasn't long
before he took the back trail." He bent closer,
and when he once more stood erect his face was
very grave. "It's Saginaw," he muttered. "I
helped him restring that left racket." Swiftly
the boy followed the tracks to the point where
the man had struck into the clearing at the rear
of the little office. "He followed me and found
me talking to Mike Gillum."</p>

<p>As Connie struck out on the back trail he smiled
grimly: "Gee, I bet he thinks I'm a bad one.
He knows the Syndicate put one over on Hurley
last winter, and now he thinks I'm hand in
glove with 'em. I would like to have run this
thing down alone, but I guess I'll have to let
Saginaw in on it now. Maybe he won't believe
me, and maybe Hurley won't, and then I'll get
fired! Anyhow, he broke a good trail for me,"
grinned the boy as he swung swiftly through the
timber. Travelling light, he made rapid progress,
and as he walked, his brain was busy trying to
solve his riddle of the woods. Mike Gillum had
told him that he had worked on several jobs with
Hurley, that he was a good lumberman, that he
could handle men, and get out the logs. Knowing
this, he had recommended him to Waseche Bill,
as foreman of his camp. Gillum said that by accident
he had seen Hurley's name on the Syndicate
pay roll and had asked one of the clerks in
the office about it, and that the clerk had winked
and told him that Hurley was well worth all the
Syndicate paid him because he was boss of an
independent outfit that was logging up on Dogfish.
It was then that Gillum had written to Waseche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a><br /><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Bill. He had known nothing of the latter's loss
of last winter until Connie had told him at the
time of their first meeting. Despite the man's
statements, Connie could not bring himself to
believe that Hurley was guilty. "There's a mistake
somewhere," he muttered as he trudged on,
"and I've got to find out where. I can't let Hurley
in on it, because he's hot-headed and he'd
jump in and spoil every chance we had of catching
the real culprit, or, if he is mixed up in it, he'd
have all the chance in the world to cover his
tracks so I never could prove anything on him.
But he isn't guilty!" This last was uttered aloud
and with the emphasis of conviction. For the
life of him the boy could not have given a good and
sufficient reason for this conviction. Indeed, all
reason was against it. But the conviction was
there, and the reason for the conviction was there&mdash;even
if the boy could not have told it&mdash;and
it ran a great deal deeper than he knew.</p>

<p>From the moment three years before, when he
had landed, a forlorn and friendless little figure,
upon the dock at Anvik, he had been thrown
among men&mdash;men crude and rough as the land
they lived in. His daily associates had been good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
men&mdash;and bad. He had known good men with
deplorable weaknesses, and bad men with admirable
virtues. In his association with these men
of the lean, lone land the boy had unconsciously
learned to take keen measure of men. And,
having taken his measure, he accepted a man at
his worth. The boy knew that Mike Gillum had
not lied to him&mdash;that under no circumstances
would he lie to injure another. But, despite the
man's positive statement, Connie's confidence in
Hurley remained unshaken. Hurley had assumed
a definite place in his scheme of things, and it
would take evidence much more tangible than an
unsubstantiated statement to displace him.</p>

<p>Under the heavily overcast sky and the thickly
interlaced branches of the pines, daylight passed
into twilight, and twilight fast deepened to darkness
as the boy pushed on through the forest.
Suddenly he halted. To his surprise, the trail he
was following turned abruptly to the west. He
knew that the fresher tracks of Saginaw's snow-shoes
had been laid over his own back trail, and
he knew that he had made no right angle turn in
his trip to Willow River. Bending close to the
snow he made out in the deep gloom other tracks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>&mdash;the
tracks of three men who had not worn
snow-shoes. The three had evidently intercepted
Saginaw and a powwow had ensued, for there
had been much trampling about in the snow.
Then Saginaw had abandoned his course and
accompanied the men to the westward.</p>

</div>

<p>"Camp Two is west of here," muttered the
boy. "I guess the men were part of Slue Foot's
crew, and he went over to the camp with 'em."
Darkness prevented him from noting that the
trail that led to the westward was a clumsier trail
than Saginaw would have made, or he never
would have dismissed the matter so lightly from
his mind. As it was, he continued upon his course
for Camp One, where he arrived nearly an hour
later to find the camp in a turmoil. The boy
hastened, unnoticed, to the edge of a crowd of men
that encircled Frenchy Lamar, who talked as fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
as he could in an almost unintelligible jargon,
which he punctuated with shrugs, and wild-flung

<p>Connie left in the middle of the Frenchman's
discourse and hurried into the office. In his
bunk, with his head swathed in bandages, lay
Hurley. The doctor stood beside the stove and
watched Steve feed the injured man gruel from a
spoon. The big boss opened his eyes as the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
entered. He smiled faintly, and with ever so
slight a motion of his head indicated Steve: "An'
I said they wasn't the worth of a lath in his hide,"
he muttered and nodded weakly as Connie crossed
swiftly to the boy's side and shook his hand.
Hurley's voice dropped almost to a whisper:
"I'll be laid up fer a couple of days. Tell Saginaw
to&mdash;keep&mdash;things&mdash;goin'."</p>

<p>"I'll tell him," answered Connie, grimly, and,
as the boss's eyes closed, stepped to his own bunk
and, catching up the service revolver from beneath
the blankets, hurried from the room.</p>

<p>Connie Morgan was a boy that experience and
training had taught to think quickly. When he
left the office it was with the idea of heading a
posse of lumberjacks in the capture of the three
I. W. W.'s, for from the moment he heard of their
escape the boy realized that these were the three
men who had intercepted Saginaw Ed on his
return from Willow River. His one thought was
to rescue the captive, for well he knew that, having
Saginaw in their power, the thugs would stop at
nothing in venting their hatred upon the helpless
man. As he hurried toward the crowd in front of
the men's camp his brain worked rapidly. Fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
men in the woods at night would make fifty times
as much noise as one man. Then again, what
would the men do if they should catch the three?
The boy paused for a moment at the corner of
the oat house. There was only one answer to
<i>that</i> question. The answer had been plain even
before the added outrage of the attack upon
Hurley&mdash;and Hurley was liked by his men.
Stronger than ever became the boy's determination
to have the I. W. W.'s dealt with by the law.
There must be no posse.</p>

<p>His mind swung to the other alternative. If
he went alone he could follow swiftly and silently.
The odds would be three against one&mdash;but the
three had only one gun between them. He
fingered the butt of his revolver confidently. "I
can wing the man with the gun, and then cover
the others," he muttered, "and besides, I'll have
all the advantage of knowing what I'm up against
while they think they're safe. Dan McKeever
was strong for that. I guess I'll go it alone."</p>

<p>Having arrived at this decision the boy crossed
the clearing to the men's camp where he singled
out Swede Larson from the edge of the crowd.
"Saginaw and I've got some special work to do,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he whispered; "you keep the men going 'til we
get back." Without waiting for a reply, he
hastened to the oat house, fastened on his snow-shoes,
and slipped into the timber.</p>

<p>It was no hardship, even in the darkness, for
him to follow the snow-shoe trail, and to the
point where the others had left it his progress
was rapid. The snow had stopped falling, and
great rifts appeared in the wind-driven clouds.
Without hesitation Connie swung into the trail
of the four men. He reasoned that they would
not travel far because when they had intercepted
Saginaw there could not have been more
than two or three hours of daylight left. The boy
followed swiftly along the trail, pausing frequently
to listen, and as he walked he puzzled over the
fact that the men had returned to the vicinity of
the camp, when obviously they should have made
for the railway and placed as much distance as
possible between themselves and the scene of
their crimes. He dismissed the thought of their
being lost, for all three were woodsmen. Why,
then, had they returned?</p>

<p>Suddenly he halted and shrank into the shelter
of a windfall. Upon the branches of the pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
trees some distance ahead his eye caught the faint
reflection of a fire.</p>

<p>Very cautiously he left the trail and, circling
among the trees, approached the light from the
opposite direction. Nearer and nearer he crept
until he could distinctly see the faces of the four
men. Crouching behind a thick tree trunk, he
could see that the men had no blankets, and that
they huddled close about the fire. He could see
Saginaw with his hands tied, seated between two
of the others. Suddenly, beyond the fire, apparently
upon the back trail of the men, a twig
snapped. Instantly one of the three leaped up,
rifle in hand, and disappeared in the woods.
Connie waited in breathless suspense. Had Swede
Larson followed him? Or had someone else taken
up the trail? In a few moments the man returned
and, taking Saginaw by the arm, jerked him
roughly to his feet and, still gripping the rifle,
hurried him into the woods away from the trail.
They passed close to Connie, and the boy thanked
his lucky star that he had circled to the north
instead of the south, or they would have immediately
blundered onto his trail. A short distance
further on, and just out of sight of the camp fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
they halted, and the man gave a low whistle.
Instantly another man stepped into the circle of
the firelight&mdash;a man bearing upon his back a
heavily laden pack surmounted by several pairs
of folded blankets. He tossed the pack into the
snow and greeted the two men who remained at
the fire with a grin. Then he produced a short
black pipe, and, as he stooped to pick up a brand
from the fire, Connie stared at him in open-mouthed
amazement.</p>

<p>The newcomer was the boss of Camp Two!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<span class="smaller">CONNIE FINDS AN ALLY</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="dropleftmin">HER'S</span> Pierce?" asked Slue Foot Magee,
as he glanced down upon the two figures
that crouched close about the little fire.</p>

<p>"He went on ahead to hunt a place to camp.
We waited to pack the stuff," lied the man, nodding
toward the pack sack that the boss of Camp Two
had deposited in the snow.</p>

<p>"I sure was surprised when Sam, here, popped
out of the woods an' told me ye'd got away an'
needed blankets an' grub. Wha'd ye do to Hurley?
An' how come ye didn't hit fer the railroad
an' make yer git-away?"</p>

<p>"We beat Hurley up a-plenty so'st he won't be
in no hurry to take no I. W. W.'s nowheres ag'in.
An' as fer hittin' fer the railroad, it's too cold fer
to ride the rods or the bumpers, an' we hain't got a
dollar between us. You'll have to stake us fer
the git-away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Slue Foot frowned: "I hain't got a cent,
neither. Come into the woods on credick&mdash;an'
hain't draw'd none."</p>

<p>"That's a fine mess we're in!" exclaimed the
leader angrily. "How fer d' ye figger we're a-goin'
to git on what little grub ye fetched in that
pack? An' wher' we goin' to&mdash;bein' as we're
broke? We hit back fer you 'cause we know'd ye
stood strong in the organization an' we had a right
to think ye'd see us through."</p>

<p>"I'll see ye through!" growled Slue Foot, impatiently.
"But I can't give ye nawthin' I hain't
got, kin I?" He stood for a few moments staring
into the fire, apparently in deep thought. "I've
got it!" he exclaimed. "The Syndicate's got a
camp 'bout ten mile north of here on Willer River.
They're short handed an' the boss'll hire anything
he kin git. Seen him in town 'fore I come out, an'
he wanted to hire me, but I was already hired to
Hurley&mdash;got a boss's job, too, an' that's better'n
what I'd got out of him. If youse fellers hadn't of
be'n in such a hurry to pull somethin' an' had of
waited 'til I come, ye wouldn't of botched the job
an' got caught."</p>

<p>"Is that so!" flared the leader. "I s'pose we'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
ort to know'd ye was goin' to be hired on this job!
An' I s'pose our instructions is not to pull no rough
stuff onless you're along to see it's done right!"</p>

<p>"They hain't nawthin' in standin' 'round
argerin'," interrupted Slue Foot. "What I was
a-goin' on to say is that youse better hike on up
to Willer River an' git ye a job. There's grub
enough in the pack to last ye twict that fer."</p>

<p>"Wher'll we tell the boss we come from? 'Taint
in reason we'd hit that fer into the woods huntin'
a job."</p>

<p>"Tell him ye got sore on me an' quit. If they's
any questions asked I'll back ye up."</p>

<p>The leader of the I. W. W.'s looked at Sam, and
Sam looked at the leader. They were in a quandary.
For reasons of their own they had not told
Slue Foot that they had picked up Saginaw&mdash;and
with Saginaw on their hands, how were they
going to follow out the boss's suggestion?</p>

<p>Behind his big tree, Connie Morgan had been
an interested listener. He knew why the men
stared blankly at each other, and chuckled to
himself at their predicament.</p>

<p>"What's to hinder someone from Camp One
a-trailin' us up there?" suggested Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trailin' ye! How they goin' to trail ye? It
was a-snowin' clean up to the time ye got to Camp
Two, an' if any one sees yer tracks around there
I'll say I sent some men up that way fer somethin'.
An' besides," he continued, glancing upward
where the clouds that had thinned into flying
scuds had thickened again, obliterating the stars,
"this storm hain't over yet. It'll be snowin'
ag'in 'fore long an' ye won't leave no more trail'n
a canoe. Anyways, that's the best way I kin
think of. If you've got a better one go to it&mdash;I've
done all I kin fer ye." There was finality in
Slue Foot's voice as he drew on his mittens, and
turned from the fire. "So long, an' good luck to
ye."</p>

<p>"So long," was the rather surly rejoinder.
"If that's the best we kin do, I s'pose we gotta do
it. Mebbe if it starts snowin' we're all right, an'
if we make it, we'll be safer up there than what we
would down along the railroad, anyways. They
won't be no one a-huntin' us in the woods."</p>

<p>"Sure they won't," agreed Slue Foot, as he
passed from sight into the timber.</p>

<p>The two beside the fire sat in silence until the
sound of Slue Foot's footsteps was swallowed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in the distance. Then Sam spoke: "What we
goin' to do with this here Saginaw?" he asked.</p>

<p>The leader glanced skyward. "It's startin' to
snow&mdash;" he leered and, stopping abruptly, rose to
his feet. "Wait till we git Pierce in here." Producing
some pieces of rope from his pocket, he
grinned. "Lucky I fetched these along when I
cut 'em off my hands. We'll give him a chanct
to see how it feels to be tied up onct." The man
stepped into the timber and a few minutes later
returned accompanied by Pierce, to whom they
immediately began to relate what had passed
between them and the boss of Camp Two.</p>

<p>The moment they seated themselves about the
fire, Connie slipped from his hiding place behind
the tree and stole noiselessly toward the spot
where the men had left Saginaw. Snow was
falling furiously now, adding the bewildering
effect of its whirling flakes to the intense blackness
of the woods. Removing his snow-shoes to avoid
leaving a wide, flat trail, the boy stepped into the
tracks of the two who had returned to the fire and,
a few moments later, was bending over a dark
form that sat motionless with its back against
the trunk of a tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's me, Saginaw," he whispered, as the keen
edge of his knife blade severed the ropes that
bound the man's hands and feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">

<span class="caption">"WHAT IN THE NAME OF TIME BE YOU DOIN' HERE?"
EXCLAIMED SAGINAW.</span>
</div>

<p>The man thrust his face close to Connie's in the
darkness. "What in the name of time be you
doin' here?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Sh-sh-sh," whispered the boy. "Come on,
we've got to get away in a hurry. There's no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
tellin' how soon those fellows will finish their
powwow."</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;git away? When we git
away from here we take them birds along, er my
name ain't Saginaw Ed! On top of tryin' to
burn up the camp they've up an' murdered Hurley,
an' they'd of done the like by me, if they'd be'n
give time to!"</p>

<p>"We'll get them, later. I know where they're
going. What we've got to do is to beat it. Step
in my tracks so they won't know there were two
of us. They'll think you cut yourself loose and
they won't try to follow in the dark, especially
if the storm holds."</p>

<p>"But them hounds has got my rackets."</p>

<p>"I've got mine, and when we get away from
here I'll put 'em on and break trail for you."</p>

<p>"Look a here, you give me yer gun an' I'll go in
an' clean up on them desperadoes. I'll show 'em if
the I. W. W.'s is goin' to run the woods! I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on! I tell you we can get 'em whenever
we want 'em&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll never want 'em no worse'n I do right now."</p>

<p>"Hurley's all right, I saw him a little while
ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"They said they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care what they said. Hurley's down
in the office, right now. Come on, and when we
put a few miles behind us, I'll tell you all you want
to know."</p>

<p>"You'll tell a-plenty, then," growled Saginaw,
only half convinced. "An' here's another thing&mdash;if
you're double crossin' me, you're a-goin' to wish
you never seen the woods."</p>

<p>The boy's only answer was a laugh, and he led,
swiftly as the intense darkness would permit,
into the woods. They had gone but a short distance
when he stopped and put on his rackets.
After that progress was faster, and Saginaw Ed,
mushing along behind, wondered at the accuracy
with which the boy held his course in the blackness
and the whirling snow. A couple of hours later,
Connie halted in the shelter of a thick windfall.
"We can rest up for a while, now," he said, "and
I'll tell you some of things you want to know."</p>

<p>"Where do you figger we're at?" asked Saginaw,
regarding the boy shrewdly.</p>

<p>"We're just off the tote road between the two
camps," answered the boy without hesitation.</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed the words and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
when he spoke the voice of Saginaw sounded hard:
"I've be'n in the woods all my life, an' it would of
bothered me to hit straight fer camp on a night
like this. They's somethin' wrong here somewheres,
kid&mdash;an' the time's come fer a showdown.
I don't git you, at all! You be'n passin' yerself
off fer a greener. Ever sence you went out an'
got that deer I've know'd you wasn't&mdash;but I
figgered it worn't none of my business. Then
when you out-figgered them hounds&mdash;that worn't
no greener's job, an' I know'd that&mdash;but, I figgered
you was all to the good. But things has happened
sence, that ain't all to the good&mdash;by a long shot.
You've got some explainin' to do, an' seein' we're
so clost to camp, we better go on to the office an'
do it around the stove."</p>

<p>"We wouldn't get much chance to powwow in
the office tonight. Hurley's there, and the doctor,
and Steve, and Lon Camden."</p>

<p>"The doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, those fellows beat Hurley up pretty bad,
but he's coming along all right. Steve stayed by
him, and the doctor said it saved his life."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that sneakin' cookee that
throw'd in with the I. W. W.?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yup."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be doggoned! But, them bein' in
the office don't alter the case none. We might's
well have things open an' above board."</p>

<p>Connie leaned forward and placed his hand on
the man's arm. "What I've got to say, I want to
say to you, and to no one else. I wanted to play
the game alone, but while I was trailing you down
from Willow River, I decided I'd have to let you
in on it."</p>

<p>"You know'd I follered you up there?"</p>

<p>"Of course I knew it. Didn't I help you string
that racket?"</p>

<p>Saginaw shook his head in resignation. "We
might's well have it out right here," he said. "I
don't git you. First off, you figger how to catch
them jaspers with the goods an' lock 'em up.
Then you throw in with Slue Foot. Then you
hike up to the Syndicate camp an' is thicker'n
thieves with the boss. Then you pop up in a
blizzard in the middle of the night an' cut me
loose. Then you turn 'round an' let them hounds
go when we could of nailed 'em where they set&mdash;seems
like you've bit off quite a contract to make
all them things jibe. Go ahead an' spit 'er out&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>an'
believe me, it'll be an earful! First, though,
you tell me where them I. W. W.'s is goin' an'
how you know. If I ain't satisfied, I'm a-goin' to
hit right back an' git 'em while the gittin's good."</p>

<p>"They're going up to work for the Syndicate
in the Willow River Camp."</p>

<p>"Know'd they was loose an' slipped up to git
'em a job, did you?" asked Saginaw sarcastically.</p>

<p>Connie grinned. "No. But there's a big job
ahead of you and me this winter&mdash;to save the
timber and clear Hurley's name."</p>

<p>"What do you know about Hurley an' the
timber?"</p>

<p>"Not as much as I will by spring. But I do
know that we lost $14,000 on this job last winter.
You see, I'm one of the owners."</p>

<p>"One of the owners!" Saginaw exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes. I've got the papers here to prove it.
You couldn't read 'em in the dark, so you'll have
to take my word for it 'til we get where you can
read 'em. Waseche Bill is my partner and we
live in Ten Bow, Alaska. Soon after Hurley's
report reached us, showing the loss, a letter came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
from Mike Gillum, saying that Hurley was in the
pay of the Syndicate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's a liar!" cried Saginaw wrathfully shaking
his mittened fist in Connie's face. "I've know'd
Hurley, man an' boy, an' they never was a squarer
feller ever swung an axe. Who is this here Mike
Gillum? Lead me to him! I'll tell him to his
face he's a liar, an' then I'll prove it by givin' him
the doggonest lickin' he ever got&mdash;an' I don't
care if he's big as a meetin' house door, neither!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Saginaw, and listen. I know
Hurley's square. But I didn't know it until I got
acquainted with him. I came clear down from
Alaska to catch him with the goods, and that's
why I hired out to him. But, Mike Gillum is
square, too. He's boss of the Syndicate camp
on Willow River. A clerk in the Syndicate office
told him that the Syndicate was paying Hurley,
and Mike wrote to Waseche Bill. He's a friend
of Waseche's&mdash;used to prospect in Alaska&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care if he used to prospeck in heaven!
He's a liar if he says Hurley ever double crossed
any one!"</p>

<p>"Hold on, I think I've got an idea of what's
going on here and it will be up to us to prove it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
The man that's doing the double crossing is Slue
Foot Magee. I didn't like his looks from the
minute I first saw him. Then he began to hint
that there were ways a forty-dollar-a-month clerk
could double his wages, and when I pretended to
fall in with his scheme he said that when they
begin laying 'em down he'll show me how to shade
the cut. And more than that, he said he had
something big he'd let me in on later, provided I
kept my eyes and ears open to what went on in
the office."</p>

<p>"An' you say you an' yer pardner owns this here
timber?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I said."</p>

<p>"Then Slue Foot's ondertook to show you a
couple of schemes where you kin steal consider'ble
money off yerself?"</p>

<p>Connie laughed. "That's it, exactly."</p>

<p>Saginaw Ed remained silent for several moments.
"Pervidin' you kin show them papers, an' from
what I've saw of you, I ain't none surprised if you
kin, how come it that yer pardner sent a kid like
you way down here on what any one ort to know
would turn out to be a rough job anyways you
look at it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"He didn't send me&mdash;I came. He wanted to
come himself, but at that time we thought it was
Hurley we were after, and Hurley knows Waseche
so he could never have found out anything, even
if he had come down. And besides, I've had
quite a lot of experience in jobs like this. I served
a year with the Mounted."</p>

<p>"The Mounted! You don't mean the Canady
Mounted Police!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>There was another long silence, then the voice of
Saginaw rumbled almost plaintively through the
dark, "Say, kid, you ain't never be'n <i>President</i>,
have you?"</p>

<p>Connie snickered. "No, I've never been President.
And if there's nothing else you want to
know right now, let's hit the hay. We've both
done some man's size mushing today."</p>

<p>"You spoke a word, kid," answered Saginaw,
rising to his feet; "I wouldn't put no crookedness
whatever past Slue Foot. But that didn't give
this here Gillum no license to blackguard Hurley
in no letter."</p>

<p>"Has Hurley ever worked for the Syndicate?"
asked Connie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, he ain't. I know every job he's had in
Minnesoty an' Westconsin. Then he went out
West to Idyho, or Montany, or somewheres, an'
this here's the first job he's had sence he come
back."</p>

<p>"What I've been thinking is that Slue Foot has
passed himself off to the Syndicate as Hurley.
They know that Hurley is boss of this camp, but
they don't know him by sight. It's a risky thing
to do, but I believe Slue Foot has done it."</p>

<p>"Well, jumpin' Jerushelam! D'you s'pose he'd
of dared?"</p>

<p>"That's what we've got to find out&mdash;and we've
got to do it alone. You know Hurley better than
I do, and you know that he's hot-headed, and
you know that if he suspected Slue Foot of doing
that, he couldn't wait to get the evidence so we
could get him with the goods. He'd just naturally
sail into him and beat him to a pulp."</p>

<p>Saginaw chuckled. "Yes, an' then he'd squeeze
the juice out of the pulp to finish off with. I guess
yer right, kid. It's up to me an' you. But how'd
you know them I. W. W.'s is headin' fer Willer
River?"</p>

<p>"Because I heard Slue Foot tell them to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Slue Foot!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I forgot to tell you that Slue Foot is an
I. W. W., too. I didn't know it myself 'til tonight.
You see, when I got back to camp and
found that Hurley's prisoners had made a get-away,
I knew right then why you had turned off the back
trail from Willow River. I knew they'd treat
you like they did Hurley, or worse, so I hit the
trail."</p>

<p>"Wasn't they no one else handy you could of
brung along?" asked Saginaw, drily.</p>

<p>"The whole camp would have jumped at the
chance&mdash;and you know it! And you know what
they'd have done when they caught 'em. I knew
I could travel faster and make less noise than a
big gang, and I knew I could handle the job when
I got there. I had slipped up and was watching
when Pierce took you into the timber. He did
that because they heard someone coming. It was
Slue Foot, and he brought 'em a grub stake and
some blankets. They knew he was an I. W. W.,
and they'd managed to slip him the word that
they were loose. They wanted him to stake them
to some money, too, but Slue Foot said he didn't
have any, and told them to get a job up on Willow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
River. He told them they'd be safer there than
they would anywhere down along the railroad."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how'd you know they'll go there?"</p>

<p>"They can't go any place else," laughed the
boy. "They're broke, and they've only got a
little bit of grub."</p>

<p>"When we goin' up an' git 'em?" persisted
Saginaw.</p>

<p>"We'll let the sheriff do that for us, then the
whole thing will be according to law."</p>

<p>"I guess that's right," assented the man, as
the two swung down the tote road.</p>

<p>"We'd better roll in in the men's camp," suggested
Connie, as they reached the clearing. A
little square of light from the office window showed
dimly through the whirling snow, and, approaching
noiselessly, the two peeked in. Mounded
blankets covered the sleeping forms of the doctor
and Lon Camden; Hurley's bandaged head was
visible upon his coarse pillow, and beside him sat
Steve, wide awake, with the bottles of medicine
within easy reach.</p>

<p>"Half past one!" exclaimed Saginaw, glancing
at the little clock. "By jiminetty, kid, it's time
we was to bed!"</p>

<span class="smaller">SHADING THE CUT</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="dropleftmin">T</span> was nine o'clock the following morning when
Connie was awakened by someone bending
over him. It was Saginaw, and the boy noticed
that his cap and mackinaw were powdered with
snow.</p>

<p>"Still snowing, eh? Why didn't you wake me
up before?"</p>

<p>"It's 'bout quit, an' as fer wakin' you up," he
grinned, "I didn't hardly dast to. If I was the
owner of an outfit an' any doggone lumberjack
woke me up 'fore I was good an' ready I'd fire
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to see my papers, do you?"
grinned Connie.</p>

<p>"Well, I might take a squint at 'em. But that
ain't what I come fer. The boss is a whole lot
better, an' the doctor's a-goin' back. What I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
want to know is, why can't he swear out them
warrants ag'in them three I. W. W.'s an' have it
over with? I didn't say nothin' to Hurley 'bout
them bein' located, er he'd of riz up an' be'n half
ways to Willer River by now."</p>

<p>"Sure, he can swear out the warrants! I'll
slip over to the office and get their names out of
the time book, and while I'm gone you might look
over these." The boy selected several papers
from a waterproof wallet which he drew from an
inner pocket and passed them over to Saginaw,
then he finished dressing and hurried over to the
office. Hurley was asleep, and, copying the names
from the book, Connie returned to the men's camp.</p>

<p>"You're the goods all right," said Saginaw,
admiringly, as he handed back the papers. "From
now on I'm with you 'til the last gap, as the feller
says. You've got more right down nerve than I
ever know'd a kid could have, an' you've got the
head on you to back it. Yer good enough fer me&mdash;you
say the word, an' I go the limit." He stuck
out his hand, which Connie gripped strongly.</p>

<p>"You didn't have to tell me that, Saginaw,"
answered the boy, gravely, "if you had, you would
never have had the chance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Saginaw Ed removed his hat and scratched his
head thoughtfully. "That there'll strike through
'bout dinner time, I guess. But I suspicion what
you mean, an'&mdash;I'm obliged."</p>

<p>"Here are the names for the doctor&mdash;better
tell him to swear out warrants both for arson and
for attempted murder."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Saginaw, respectfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>what!</i>"</p>

<p>The man grinned sheepishly. "Why&mdash;I guess&mdash;bein'
I was talkin' to the owner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Saginaw," interrupted the boy,
wrathfully, "you just forget this 'owner' business,
and don't you start 'siring' me! What do you
want to do&mdash;give this whole thing away? Up
where I live they don't call a man 'sir' just because
he happens to have a little more dust than somebody
else. It ain't the 'Misters' and the 'Sirs'
that are the big men up there; it's the 'Bills' and
the 'Jacks' and the 'Scotties' and the 'Petes'&mdash;men
that would get out and mush a hundred miles
to carry grub to a scurvy camp instead of sitting
around the stove and hiring someone else to do it&mdash;men
that have gouged gravel and stayed with the
game, bucking the hardest winters in the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
sometimes with only half enough to eat&mdash;men
with millions, and men that don't own the tools
they work with! My own father was one of 'em.
'The unluckiest man in Alaska,' they called him!
He never made a strike, but you bet he was a man!
There isn't a man that knew him, from Skagway
to Candle, and from Candle to Dawson and
beyond, that isn't proud to call him friend. Sam
Morgan they call him&mdash;and they don't put any
'Mister' in front of it, either!"</p>

<p>Saginaw Ed nodded slowly, and once more he
seized the boy's hand in a mighty grip. "I git
you, kid. I know they's a lot of good men up in
your country&mdash;but, somehow, I've got a hunch
they kind of overlooked a bet when they're callin'
your pa onlucky." He took the slip of paper
upon which Connie had written the names. At
the door he turned. "We begin layin' 'em down
today," he said. "Shouldn't wonder an' what
Slue Foot'll be down 'fore very long fer to give
you yer first lesson."</p>

<p>"Hurley will think I'm a dandy, showing up
at ten o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"Never you mind that," said Saginaw; "I
fixed that part up all right&mdash;told him you was up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
'til after one o'clock helpin' me git things strung
out fer to begin work today."</p>

<p>Connie bolted a hasty breakfast, and, as he
made his way from the cook's camp to the office,
sounds came from the woods beyond the clearing&mdash;the
voices of men calling loudly to each other as
they worked, the ring of axes, and the long crash
of falling trees. The winter's real work had
begun, and Connie smiled grimly as he thought
of the cauldron of plot and counter-plot that was
seething behind the scenes in the peaceful logging
camp.</p>

<p>The boy found Hurley much improved, although
still weak from the effects of the terrible beating
he had received at the hands of the escaped prisoners.
The big boss fumed and fretted at his
enforced inactivity, and bewailed the fact that he
had given the doctor his word that he would stay
in his bunk for at least two days longer. "An'
ut's partly yer fault, wid yer talk av th' law&mdash;an'
partly mine fer listenin' to yez," he complained
fiercely, in rich brogue, as Connie sat at his desk.
The boy's shoulders drooped slightly under the
rebuke, but he answered nothing. Suddenly
Hurley propped himself up on his elbow. "Phy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
don't yez tell me Oi'm a big liar?" he roared.
"Ye was right, an' Oi know ut. Don't pay no
heed to me, kid. Oi've got a grouch fer lettin'
them shpalpeens git away. Furst Oi was thryin'
to lay ut on Frinchy, an' him the bist teamster
in th' woods! Ut's loike a sp'ilt b'y Oi am, thryin'
to blame somewan f'r what c'udn't be helped
at all. Ut was an accident all togither, an' a
piece av bad luck&mdash;an' there's an end to ut.
Bring me over yer book, now, an' Oi'll show ye
about kaypin' thim logs."</p>

<span class="caption">"PHY DON'T YEZ TELL ME OI'M A BIG LIAR?" HE ROARED.</span>
</div>

<p>Connie soon learned the simple process of bookkeeping,
and hardly had he finished when the
door opened and Slue Foot Magee entered.</p>

<p>"Well, well! They sure beat ye up bad, boss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
I heerd about it on my way down. I'd like to
lay hands on them crooks, an' I bet they'd think
twict before they beat another man up! But yer
a fightin' man, Hurley; they must of got ye foul."</p>

<p>"Foul is the word. When the wagon tipped
over my head hit a tree an' that's the last I remember
'til I come to an' the boy, Steve, was
bathin' my head with snow an' tyin' up my cuts
with strips of his shirt."</p>

<p>"Too bad," condoled Slue Foot, shaking his
head sympathetically; "an' they got plumb
away?"</p>

<p>"Sure they did. It wasn't so far to the railroad,
an' the snow fallin' to cover their tracks.
But, Oi'll lay holt av 'em sometime!" he cried,
relapsing into his brogue. "An' whin Oi do, law
er no law, Oi'll bust 'em woide open clane to their
dirty gizzards!"</p>

<p>"Sure ye will!" soothed Slue Foot. "But,
it's better ye don't go worryin' about it now.
They're miles away, chances is, mixed up with a
hundred like 'em in some town er nother. I
started the cuttin' this mornin'. I'm workin' to
the north boundary, an' then swing back from
the river."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Hurley nodded: "That's right. We want to
make as good a showin' as we kin this year, Slue
Foot. Keep 'em on the jump, but don't crowd
'em too hard."</p>

<p>Slue Foot turned to Connie: "An' now, if
ye hain't got nawthin' better to do than set there
an' beaver that pencil, ye kin come on up to Camp
Two an' I'll give ye the names of the men."</p>

<p>"If you didn't have anything better to do than
hike down here, why didn't you stick a list of the
names in your pocket?" flashed the boy, who had
found it hard to sit and listen to the words of the
double-dealing boss of Camp Two.</p>

<p>"Kind of sassy, hain't ye?" sneered Slue Foot.
"We'll take that out of ye, 'fore yer hair turns
grey. D'ye ever walk on rackets?"</p>

<p>"Some," answered Connie. "I guess I can
manage to make it."</p>

<p>Slue Foot went out, and Hurley motioned the
boy to his side. "Don't pay no heed to his
growlin' an' grumblin', it was born in him," he
whispered.</p>

<p>"I'll show him one of these days I ain't afraid
of him," answered the boy, so quickly that Hurley
laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurry along, then," he said. "An' if ye
git back in time I've a notion to send ye out after
a pa'tridge. Saginaw says yer quite some sport
with a rifle."</p>

<p>"That's the way to work it, kid," commended
Slue Foot, as Connie bent over the fastenings of his
snow-shoes. "I'll growl an' you sass every time
we're ketched together. 'Twasn't that I'd of
made ye hike way up to my camp jest fer to copy
them names, but the time's came fer to begin to
git lined up on shadin' the cut, an' we jest nachelly
had to git away from the office. Anyways it
won't hurt none to git a good trail broke between
the camps."</p>

<p>"There ain't any chance of getting caught at
this graft, is there?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Naw; that is, 'tain't one chanct in a thousan'.
Course, it stan's to reason if a man's playin' fer
big stakes he's got to take a chanct. Say, where'd
you learn to walk on rackets? You said you
hadn't never be'n in the woods before."</p>

<p>"I said I'd never worked in the woods&mdash;I've
hunted some."</p>

<p>The talk drifted to other things as the two
plodded along the tote road, but once within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
little office at Camp Two, Slue Foot plunged immediately
into his scheme. "It's like this: The
sawyers gits paid by the piece&mdash;the more they cut,
the more pay they git. The logs is scaled after
they're on the skidways. Each pair of sawyers
has their mark they put on the logs they cut, an'
the scaler puts down every day what each pair
lays down. Then every night he turns in the
report to you, an' you copy it in the log book.
The total cut has got to come out right&mdash;the scaler
knows all the time how many feet is banked on the
rollways. I've got three pair of sawyers that's
new to the game, an' they hain't a-goin' to cut
as much as the rest. The scaler won't never look
at your books, 'cause it hain't none of his funeral
if the men don't git what's a-comin' to 'em. He
keeps his own tally of the total cut. Same with
the walkin' boss&mdash;that's Hurley. All he cares is
to make a big showin'. He'll have an eye on the
total cut, an' he'll leave it to Saginaw an' me to see
that the men gits what's comin' to 'em in our own
camps. Now, what you got to do is to shade a
little off each pair of sawyers' cut an' add it onto
what's turned in fer them three pair I told you
about. Then, in the spring, when these birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
cashes their vouchers in town, I'm right there to
collect the overage."</p>

<p>"But," objected Connie, "won't the others
set up a howl? Surely, they will know that
these men are not cutting as much as they
are."</p>

<p>"How they goin' to find out what vouchers
them six turns in? They hain't a-goin' to show
no one their vouchers."</p>

<p>"But, won't the others know they're being
credited with a short cut?"</p>

<p>"That's where you come in. You got to take
off so little that they won't notice it. Sawyers only
knows <i>about</i> how much they got comin'. They
only guess at the cut. A little offen each one
comes to quite a bit by spring."</p>

<p>"But, what if these men that get the overage
credited to 'em refuse to come across?"</p>

<p>Slue Foot grinned evilly: "I'll give 'em a
little bonus fer the use of their names," he said.
"But, they hain't a-goin' to refuse to kick in.
I've got their number. They hain't a one of the
hull six of 'em that I hain't got somethin' on, an'
they know it."</p>

<p>"All right," said Connie, as he arose to go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
"I'm on. And don't forget that you promised
to let me in on something bigger, later on."</p>

<p>"I won't fergit. It looks from here like me an'
you had a good thing."</p>

<p>An hour later Connie once more entered the
office at Camp One. Steve sat beside Hurley,
and Saginaw Ed stood warming himself with his
back to the stove.</p>

<p>"Back ag'in," greeted the big boss. "How
about it, ye too tired to swing out into the brush
with the rifle? Seems like they wouldn't nothin'
in the world taste so good as a nice fat pa'tridge.
An' you tell the cook if he dries it up when he
roasts it, he better have his turkey packed an'
handy to grab."</p>

<p>"I'm not tired at all," smiled Connie, as he
took Saginaw's rifle from the wall. "It's too bad
those fellows swiped your gun, but I guess I can
manage to pop off a couple of heads with this."</p>

<p>"You'd better run along with him, Steve,"
said Hurley, as he noted that the other boy eyed
Connie wistfully. "The walk'll do ye good. Ye
hain't hardly stretched a leg sense I got hurt.
The kid don't mind, do ye, kid?"</p>

<p>"You bet I don't!" exclaimed Connie heartily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
"Come on, Steve, we'll tree a bunch of 'em and
then take turns popping their heads off."</p>

<p>As the two boys made their way across the
clearing, Hurley raised himself on his elbow, and
stared after them through the window: "Say,
Saginaw," he said, "d'ye know there's a doggone
smart kid."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked the other, as he spat indifferently
into the wood box.</p>

<p>"Why, this here Connie. Fer a greener, I never
see his beat."</p>

<p>"Yeh," answered Saginaw, drily, his eyes also
upon the retreating backs, "he's middlin' smart,
all right. Quite some of a kid&mdash;fer a greener."</p>

<span class="smaller">SAGINAW ED HUNTS A CLUE</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">"H</span><span class="dropleftmin">ELLO!"</span> cried Saginaw Ed, as he stared in
surprise at a wide, flat trail in the snow.
The exclamation brought Connie Morgan to his
side. The two were hunting partridges and rabbits,
and their wanderings had carried them to the
extreme western edge of the timber tract, several
miles distant from the camps that were located
upon the Dogfish River, which formed its eastern
boundary. Despite the fact that the work of both
camps was in full swing, these two found frequent
opportunity to slip out into the timber for a few
hours' hunt, which answered the twofold purpose
of giving them a chance to perfect their plans for
the undoing of Slue Foot Magee, and providing a
welcome addition to the salt meat bill of fare.</p>

<p>"Wonder who's be'n along here? 'Tain't no
one from the camps&mdash;them's Injun snow-shoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
An' they ain't no one got a right to hunt here,
neither. Hurley posted the hull trac' account of
not wantin' no permiscu's shootin' goin' on with
the men workin' in the timber. Them tracks is
middlin' fresh, too."</p>

<p>"Made yesterday," opined Connie, as he examined
the trail closely. "Travelling slow, and
following his own back trail."</p>

<p>Saginaw nodded approval. "Yup," he agreed.
"An', bein' as he was travellin' slow, he must of
went quite a little piece. He wasn't carryin' no
pack."</p>

<p>"Travelling light," corroborated the boy. "And
he went up and came back the same day."</p>

<p>"Bein' as he headed north and come back from
there, it ain't goin' to do us no hurt to kind of find
out if he's hangin' 'round clost by. They ain't
nothing north of us, in a day's walk an' back, except
the Syndicate's Willer River camp. An',
spite of yer stickin' up fer him, I don't trust that
there Mike Gillum, nor no one else that would
claim Hurley throw'd in with the Syndicate."
The man struck into the trail, and Connie followed.
They had covered scarcely half a mile when Saginaw
once more halted in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'll be doggoned if there ain't a dugout!
An' onless I'm quite a bit off my reckonin', it's
inside our line." For several moments the two
scrutinized the structure, which was half cabin,
half dugout. From the side of a steep bank the
log front of the little building protruded into the
ravine. Smoke curled lazily from a stovepipe
that stuck up through the snow-covered roof.
The single window was heavily frosted, and a deep
path had been shovelled through a huge drift that
reached nearly to the top of the door. The trail
the two had been following began and ended at
that door, and without hesitation they approached
and knocked loudly. The door opened, and in the
dark oblong of the interior stood the grotesque
figure of a little old man. A pair of bright, watery
eyes regarded them from above a tangle of grey
beard, and long grey hair curled from beneath a cap
of muskrat skin from which the fur was worn in irregular
patches. "Phwat d'yez want?" he whined, in
a voice cracked and thin. "Is ut about me money?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/i-p-178.jpg" width="395" height="455" alt="" id="ILLUS_178" /><br />
<span class="caption">"PHWAT D'YEZ WANT?" HE WHINED.</span>
</div>

<p>"Yer money?" asked Saginaw. "We don't
know nothin' about no money. We're from the
log camps over on Dogfish. What we want to
know is what ye're doin' here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doin' here!" exclaimed the little old man.
"Oi'm livin' here, that's what Oi'm doin'&mdash;jest like
Oi've done f'r fifteen year. Come on in av ye want
to palaver. Oi'm owld an' like to freeze standin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
here in th' dure, an' if ye won't come in, g'wan
away, an' bad cess to yez f'r not bringin' me back
me money."</p>

<p>Saginaw glanced at Connie and touched his forehead
significantly. As they stepped into the
stuffy interior, the old man closed the door and
fastened it with an oak bar. Little light filtered
through the heavily frosted window, and in the
semi-darkness the two found difficulty picking
their way amid the litter of traps, nets, and firewood
that covered the floor. The little room
boasted no chair, but, seating himself upon an upturned
keg, the owner motioned his visitors to the
bunk that was built along the wall within easy
reach of the little cast iron cooking stove that
served also to heat the room.</p>

<p>"Ye say ye've lived here for fifteen years?"
asked Saginaw, as he drew off his heavy mittens.</p>

<p>"Oi have thot."</p>

<p>"Ye wasn't here last winter."</p>

<p>"Thot's whut Oi'm afther tellin' yez. Last
winter I wuz to the city."</p>

<p>"This here shack looks like it's old, all right,"
admitted Saginaw. "Funny no one run acrost it
last winter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ut snowed airly," cut in the little man, "an'
if they ain't no wan here to dig her out, she'd drift
plumb under on th' furst wind."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Connie. "And what do
you do for a living? And what did you mean
about your money?"</p>

<p>"Who sh'd Oi be but Dinny O'Sullivan? 'An'
phwat do Oi do fer a livin'?' sez ye. 'Til last winter
Oi worked f'r Timothy McClusky, thot owned
this trac' an' w'd died befoor he'd av sold ut to th'
Syndicate. Good wages, he paid me, an' Oi kep'
off th' timber thayves, an' put out foires, an' what
not. An' Oi thrapped an' fished betoimes an' Oi
made me a livin'. Thin, McClusky sold th' timber.
'Ye betther come on back wid me, Dinny,'
sez he. 'Back to the owld sod. Ut's rich Oi'll
be over there, Dinny, an' Oi'll see ye'll niver
want.'</p>

<p>"But, ut's foorty year an' more since Oi come to
Amurica, an' Oi'd be a stranger back yon. 'Oi'll
stay,' Oi sez, 'f'r Oi've got used to th' woods, an'
whin they cut down th' timber, Oi'll move on till
somewheres they ain't cut.' 'Ut's hatin' Oi am
to lave yez behind, Dinny,' sez he, 'but, Oi won't
lave ye poor, fer ye've served me well,' an' wid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
thot, he puts his hand in his pocket loike, an' pulls
out some bills, an' he hands 'em to me. 'Put 'em
by f'r a rainy day, Dinny,' he sez, an' thin he wuz
gone. Oi come insoide an' barred th' dure, an'
Oi counted th' money in me hand. Tin bills they
wuz, all bright an' new an' clane, an' aich bill wuz
foive hunder' dollars. 'Twas more money thin
Oi'd iver see, or thought to see, an' ut wuz all
moine&mdash;moine to kape or to spind, to t'row away
er to save. 'Oi'll save ut,' sez Oi, 'loike McClusky
said, ag'in' a rainy day.' An' Oi loosed a board in
th' flure&mdash;'tiz th' wan to th' left in under th' bunk,
yonder&mdash;an' Oi put th' bills in a tobaccy tin an'
put 'em in th' hole Oi'd scooped out, an' put back
th' board." The little old man paused and poked
noisily at the stove, fumbled in his pockets and
produced a short, black cutty pipe and a pouch of
tobacco, and continued:</p>

<p>"Oi've wor-rked hard from six years owld to
siventy, but ut's not in th' name av O'Sullivan to
lay an-nything by. 'Twus come hard an' go
aisy&mdash;but f'r a month Oi niver lifted th' board.
Thin wan day Oi tuk 'em out an' counted 'em.
Th' nixt wake Oi done th' same. Th' days begun
to git shorter, an' th' noights colder, an' th' ducks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
come whistlin' out av th' narth. Ivery day, now,
Oi'd take thim bills out an' count 'em. Oi cut
three little notches in the carners wid me knife&mdash;'tis
the mark Oi file on me thraps, so whin an-nyone
sees 'em, 'Tiz Dinny O'Sullivan's bill,' they'll say,
an' Oi can't lose 'em. ''Tiz a cowld winter comin',
Dinny,' sez Oi, 'f'r th' mushrats is buildin' airly.
Yer gittin' owld f'r th' thrappin',' sez Oi, but Oi
know'd 'twuz a loie whin Oi said ut; 'beloike ye'd
betther go to th' city.' 'Ye'll not!' sez Oi, moindin'
what McClusky said about a rainy day. An'
Oi put back th' bills an' covered thim wid th'
board. Th' nixt day ut wuz cloudy an' cowld, an'
Oi set be th' stove an' counted me bills. 'Th'
loights is bright av an avenin' in th' city, Dinny,'
Oi sez, 'an' there's shows an' what not, an' min av
yer koind to palaver. Ut's loike a mink ye'll be
livin' in yer hole in th' woods av ye stay. There's
too much money, an-nyhow,' Oi sez; 'av ye don't
git sick, ye don't nade ut, an' if ye do, 'twill outlast
ye, an' whin ye die, who'll have th' spindin' av
thim clane new bills? They's prob'ly O'Sullivans
lift unhung yit in Oirland,' sez Oi&mdash;though av me
mimory's good, they's few that aught to be&mdash;'Oi'll
spend 'em mesilf.' Th' wind wailed t'rough th'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
trees loike th' banshee. Oi looked out th' windie&mdash;'twuz
rainin'. ''Tis a token,' sez Oi; ''tiz th'
rainy day thot McClusky said w'd come.'" The
old man chuckled. "'Tiz loike thot a man argys
whin ut's himself's th' judge an' jury.</p>

<p>"So Oi put th' bills in me pocket an' tuck th'
thrain fer St. Paul. Oi seen Moike Gillum on th'
thrain an' Oi show'd um me money. 'Go back
to th' woods, Dinny,' he sez. 'There's no fool
loike an owld fool, ye'll moind, an' they'll have
ut away from yez.' 'They'll not!' sez Oi. 'An'
Oi'll be betther fer a year av rist.' He thried to
argy but Oi'd have none av ut, an' Oi put up wid
th' Widdy MacShane, 'twuz half-sister to a cousin
av a frind av moine Oi know'd in Brainard in
nointy-sivin. Foive dollars a week Oi paid fer
board an' room an' washin'&mdash;Oi'd live in style wid
no thought fer expince. Oi bought me a hat an'
a suit wid brass buttons t'w'd done proud to Brian
Boru himsilf."</p>

<p>The old man paused and looked out the window.
"To make a long story short, be Christmas Oi wuz
toired av me bargain. Oi've lived in th' woods too
long, an' Oi'll lave 'em no more. Oi stuck ut out
'til th' spring, but, what wid th' frinds Oi'd picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
up to hilp me spind ut, an' th' clothes, an' th' shows
ut costed me three av me clane new bills. Comin'
back Oi shtopped off at Riverville, an' showed
Mike Gillum the sivin Oi had lift. 'Yez done well,
Dinny,' sez he. 'An' now will yez go to th'
woods?' 'Oi will,' sez Oi, 'f'r Oi'm tired av ristin'.
But Oi'm glad Oi wint, an' Oi don't begrudge th'
money, f'r sivin is aisier thin tin to count an-nyway
an' Oi've enough av ut rains f'r a year.' So Oi
come back an' wuz snug as a bug in a rug, 'til ut's
mebbe two wakes ago, an' snowin' that day, an'
they comed a Frinchy along, an' he sez, 'Oi've a
noice fat deer hangin'; ut's a matther av a couple
av moile from here. Av ye'll hilp me cut um up,
Oi'll give ye th' shoulders an' rib mate&mdash;f'r ut's
only th' quarters Oi want.' Oi wint along an' we
cut up th' deer, an' he give me th' mate an' Oi
packed ut home. Whin Oi got back Oi seen somewan
had be'n here. Ut wuz snowin' hard, an' th'
thracks wuz drifted full loike th' wans me an' th'
Frinchy made whin we started off to cut up th'
deer, so Oi know'd the other had come jist afther
we lift. I dropped me mate an' run in an' pulled
up th' board. Th' tobaccy tin wuz impty! Th'
thracks headed narth, an' Oi tuck out afther th'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
dirthy spalpeen, but th' snow got worse an' Oi had
to turn back. Whin ut quit Oi wint to Willow
River where Mike Gillum is runnin' a Syndicate
crew, but he said they wuzn't none av his men
gone off th' job. 'Oi'll do all Oi kin to thry an'
locate th' thafe,' sez he; 'but yez sh'd put yer
money in th' bank, Dinny.' Well, Oi hurd nawthin'
more from him, an' this marnin' Oi wint
up there ag'in. He'd found out nawthin', an' he
sez how he don't think ut wuz wan av his min&mdash;so
Oi comed back, an' th' nixt thing Oi knows yez two
comed along&mdash;ye've th' whole story now, an' ye'll
know av th' rainy days comes, Dinny O'Sullivan's
a-goin' to git wet."</p>

<p>"What d'ye think of yer fine friend, Mike Gillum
now?" asked Saginaw Ed, breaking a silence
that had lasted while they had travelled a mile or
so through the woods from Denny O'Sullivan's
cabin.</p>

<p>"Just the same as I did before," answered Connie,
without a moment's hesitation. "You don't
think Mike Gillum swiped the old man's money,
do you?"</p>

<p>Saginaw stopped in his tracks and faced the boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>wrathfully. "Oh, no! I don't think he could
possibly have swiped it," he said, with ponderous
sarcasm. "There ain't no chanct he did&mdash;seein'
as he was the only one that know'd the money
was there&mdash;an' seein' how the tracks headed north&mdash;an'
seein' how he denied it. It couldn't of be'n
him! The old man's got his own word fer it that
it wasn't."</p>

<p>"If those I. W. W.'s wer'n't locked up safe in
jail, I'd think they got the money. I know it
wasn't Mike Gillum," maintained the boy,
stoutly. "If you knew Mike you wouldn't think
that."</p>

<p>"I don't know him, an' I don't want to know
him! It's enough that I know Hurley. An' anyone
that would claim Hurley was crooked, I
wouldn't put it beyond him to do nothin' whatever
that's disreligious, an' low-down, an' onrespectable.
He done it! An' him writin' like he done about
Hurley, <i>proves</i> that he done it&mdash;an' that's all they
is to it."</p>

<p>Connie saw the uselessness of arguing with the
woodsman whose devoted loyalty to his boss prevented
his seeing any good whatever in the man
who had sought to cast discredit upon him. "All
right," he grinned. "But I'm going to find out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
who did do it, and I bet when I do, it won't be
Mike Gillum that's to blame."</p>

<p>Saginaw's momentary huff vanished, and he
shook his head in resignation, as he returned the
boy's grin. "I've saw a raft of folks, take it first
an' last, but never none that was right down as
stubborn as what you be. But, about findin' out
who got the old man's money, you've bit off more
than you kin chaw. You ain't got enough to go
on." A partridge flew up with a whirr and settled
upon the bare branch of a young birch a few yards
farther on. Saginaw took careful aim and shot its
head off. "I got one on you this time, anyhow.
That's five fer me, an' four fer you, an' it's gittin'
too dark to see the sights."</p>

<p>"Guess that's right," admitted the boy. "But
I'll get even, when I show you who raided the old
man's cabin."</p>

<p>"'Spect I'll do a little projektin' 'round myself,
if I git time. It might be such a thing I'll git <i>two</i>
on ye." Thus they engaged in friendly banter
until the yellow lights that shone from the windows
of the camp buildings welcomed them across the
clearing.</p>

<p>The next day Connie hunted up Frenchy Lamar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
He found him in the stable carefully removing the
ice bangles from the fetlocks of his beloved horses.
He had spent the morning breaking trail on the
tote road.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get yourself some real horses?"
teased the boy. "One of those log team horses will
outweigh the whole four of yours."</p>

<p>"Log team! <i>Sacre!</i> Dem hosses fat, lak wan
peeg! Dey go 'bout so fas' lak wan porkypine!
Dey drag de log 'roun' de woods. Dey got for
have de ice road for haul de beeg load to de rollway.
But, me&mdash;I'm tak' ma four gran' hoss, I'm heetch

ain' trade wan leetle chonk ma hoss's tail for all

<p>"You're all right, Frenchy," laughed the
boy. "But, tell me, why didn't you slip me a
chunk of that venison you brought in the other
day?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman glanced about swiftly. "<i>Non!</i>
W'at you mean&mdash;de <i>venaison</i>? I ain' keel no deer&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>me.
Hurley she say you ain' kin keel no deer
w'en de season ees close."</p>

<p>"Sure, I know you didn't kill it. But you
brought it in. What I want to know is, who did
kill it?"</p>

<p>"I ain' breeng no <i>venaison</i> een dis camp since de
season git shut."</p>

<p>"Oh, you took it to Camp Two! Slue Foot shot
the deer, did he?"</p>

<p>"How you fin' dat out? Hurley ain' lak I'm
tak' de <i>venaison</i> to Camp Two, no mor' lak Camp
Wan. She fin' dat out she git mad, I'm t'ink she
bus' me wan on ma nose."</p>

<p>"Hurley don't know anything about it," reassured
the boy. "And I'll give you my word he
never will find out from me. I just happen to
want to know who sent you after that meat. I
won't squeal on either one of you. You can trust
me, can't you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>," answered the teamster, without hesitation.
"You pass de word&mdash;dat good. Slue Foot,
she keel dat deer wan tam, an' hang heem oop to
freeze. Wan day she say, 'Frenchy, you go rat
ovaire on de wes' line an' git de deer wat I'm got

'She startin' for snow an' you track git cover oop.
Me an' you we have wan gran' feast in de office,
an' Hurley she ain' gon fin dat out. Wan leetle

man, an' lak to git som' meat.' I'm t'ink dat

man de meat, so I gon an' done lak he says."</p>

<p>"It was snowing that day, was it?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>, she snow hard all day. I'm git back 'bout
noon, an' ma tracks ees snow full."</p>

<p>"Was Slue Foot here when you got back?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>, an' dat night we hav' de gran' suppaire.
Slue Foot say dat better you ain' say nuttin' 'bout
dat deer, 'cause Hurley she git mad lak t'undaire.
I'm tell you 'bout dat 'cause I'm know you ain'
gon' try for mak' no trouble. Plenty deer in de
woods, anyhow."</p>

<p>Connie nodded. "Yes, but orders are orders.
If I were you I wouldn't have anything to do
with deer killed out of season. Suppose Hurley
had found out about that deer instead of me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
You'd have been in a nice fix. When Hurley gives
an order he generally sees that it's obeyed."</p>

<p>"Dat rat," agreed Frenchy, with alacrity.
"Dat better I ain' got Hurley mad on me, ba

in the little office by the sound of bells.
There was a loud "Whoa!" and Frenchy, wearing
his long stocking cap of brilliant red yarn, and clad
in his gayest mackinaw, pulled up his four-horse
tote-team with a flourish before the door, and
stepped smiling from the sleigh.</p>

<p>"W'at you t'ink, now, <i>m's'u l'infant</i>? S'pose
I'm trade ma gran' team for de beeg fat log hoss,
de cook she don' git no supply for wan week. Den,
mebbe-so you got to eat porkypine an' spruce tea.
Me&mdash;I'm back to-mor' night, wit ma gran' tote-team,
<i>bien!</i>"</p>

<p>Connie laughed. "I guess you've got the right
team for the job, Frenchy. But it seems to me
you picked out a bad day for the trail." It had
turned suddenly warm during the night, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
boy indicated a shallow pool of muddy water
that had collected in the depression before the
door.</p>

<p>"De snow she melt fas' w'ere she all tromp down
an' dirty, but on de tote road w'ere she w'ite an'
clean she ain' melt so fas'." He paused and
cocked an eye skyward. "I'm git to Dogfish before
she melt an' tonight she gon' for turn col', an'
tomor', ba goss, I'm com' back on de ice, lak de
log road."</p>

<span class="caption">"WHAT'S THIS?" ASKED THE BOY, PUSHING UP A SMALL BUNDLE.</span>
</div>

<p>"What's this?" asked the boy, picking up a
small bundle done up in brown wrapping paper
that lay upon the seat of the sleigh.</p>

<p>"Oh, dat wan pair wool sock Slue Foot sen'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
down to Corky Dyer for ke'p he's feet wa'm. I'm
mak' dat go on de, w'at you call, de express."</p>

<p>Connie picked up the package and regarded it
with apparent unconcern. "Who's Corky Dyer?"
he asked, casually.</p>

<p>"Corky Dyer, she ke'p de s'loon down to Brainard.
She frien' for Slue Foot, lak wan brudder."</p>

<p>As Frenchy's glance strayed to Steve, who came
hurrying toward them with his list of supplies from
the cook's camp, Connie's foot suddenly slipped,
the package dropped from his hand squarely into
the middle of the puddle of dirty water, and the
next instant the boy came heavily down upon it
with his knee.</p>

<p>"O-o-o-o!" wailed the excitable Frenchman,
dancing up and down. "Now I'm ketch, w'at you
call, de t'undaire! Slue Foot, she git mad on me
now, ba goss! She say, 'You mak' dat leetle
package los' I'm bre'k you in two!'"</p>

<p>Connie recovered the package, from which the
wet paper was bursting in a dozen places. He
glanced at it ruefully for a moment, and then, as
if struck with a happy thought, he grinned. "We'll
fix that all right," he said reassuringly, and turned
toward the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Non</i>," protested Frenchy, dolefully, "dat ain'
no good, to put on de new <i>papier</i>. De sock she
got wet, an' de new <i>papier</i> she bus', too."</p>

<p>"You just hold your horses&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ain't got for hol' dem hosses. Dey broke to
stan' so long I want 'em."</p>

<p>"Come on in the office, then," laughed the boy,
"and I'll show you how we'll fix it." Frenchy
followed him in, and Connie opened the wanagan
chest. "We'll just make a new package, socks and
all, and I'll copy the address off on it, and Corky
Dyer's feet will keep warm this winter just the
same."</p>

<p>"<i>Oui! Oui!</i>" approved the Frenchman, his
face once more all smiles. He patted the boy
admiringly upon the back. "You got de gran'
head on you for t'ink."</p>

<p>"You don't need to say anything about this to
Slue Foot," cautioned the boy.</p>

<p>The Frenchman laughed. "Ha! Ha! You
t'ink I'm gon' hont de trouble? Slue Foot she git
mad jes' de sam'. She lak for chance to growl.
I tell him 'bout dat, I'm t'ink he bus' me in two."</p>

<p>It was but the work of a few minutes to duplicate
the small bundle, and the teamster took it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
from the boy's hand with a sigh of relief. "So
long!" he called gaily, as he climbed into the sleigh
and gathered up his reins with an air. "Som' tam'
you lak you git de fas' ride, you com' long wit' me."
His long whip cracked, and the impatient tote-team
sprang out onto the trail.</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded outside the door, and Connie
hurriedly thrust the package into his turkey.
Saginaw entered, and, with a vast assumption of
carelessness, walked to the wall and took down his
rifle. "Guess I might's well take a siyou out into
the brush an' see what fer meat they is stirrin'."</p>

<p>"Want a partner?"</p>

<p>"Sure," answered the man, "I wish't you could
go 'long, but I don't guess you better. The log
roads is softenin' up, an' I give orders to keep the
teams offen 'em. They ain't nothin'll sp'ile a log
road like teamin' on 'em soft. The teamsters
won't have nothin' to do, an' they'll be hornin' in
on ye all day, to git stuff out of the wanagan.
Hurley an' Lon's both up to Camp Two, so I guess
yer elected to stick on the job."</p>

<p>"That's so," answered the boy, "but, I bet the
real reason you don't want me is because you're
afraid I'd kill more game than you do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, ye might, at that," laughed Saginaw.
"But we'll have plenty of chances to try out that
part of it. I'm gittin' old, but I ain't so old but
what I kin see the sights of a rifle yet." He drew
the rackets from under his bunk and passed out,
and as Connie watched him swing across the clearing,
he grinned:</p>

<p>"You're hiking out to see if you can't hang a
little evidence up against Mike Gillum, and that's
why you didn't want me along. Go to it, old
hand, but unless I miss my guess when you come
in tonight you'll find out that your game has
turned into crow."</p>

<p>Saginaw had prophesied rightly. The wanagan
did a land-office business among the idle teamsters,
and at no time during the day did Connie dare to
open the package that lay concealed in his turkey.
Darkness came, and the boy lighted the lamp.
The teamsters continued to straggle in and out,
and, just as the boy was about to lock the office
and go to supper, Saginaw returned.</p>

<p>"What luck?" inquired Connie.</p>

<p>"Never got a decent shot all day," replied the
man, as he put away his rifle and snow-shoes. "I
got somethin' to tell you, though, when we've et<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
supper. Chances is, Hurley an' Lon'll be late if
they ain't back by now. We kin powwow in the
office onless they come, an' if they do, we kin mosey
out an' hunt us up a log."</p>

<p>Supper over, the two returned to the office and
seated themselves beside the stove. Saginaw filled
his pipe and blew a great cloud of blue smoke toward
the ceiling. "I swung 'round by Willer
River," he imparted, after a few shorter puffs.
Connie waited for him to proceed. "Ye mind, the
old man said how it was a Frenchy that got him
to help cut up that deer? Well, they's a raft of
French workin' up there fer the Syndicate."</p>

<p>"Any of 'em been deer hunting lately?" asked
the boy, innocently.</p>

<p>"Gosh sakes! How'd ye s'pose I kin tell? If
I'd asked 'em they'd all said 'no.' I jes' wanted
to see if they was Frenchmens there."</p>

<p>Connie nodded. "That looks bad," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Yes, an' what's comin' looks worst. On the
way back, I swung 'round by the old Irishman's.
He hadn't heard nothin' more from this here Mike
Gillum, so he went up ag'in yesterday to see him.
Gillum claimed he hadn't found out nothin', an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
then the old man told him how he was broke an'
needed grub to winter through on. Well, Gillum
up an' dug down in his pocket an' loant him a hundred
dollars!"</p>

<p>"Good for Mike Gillum!" exclaimed Connie.
"That's what I call a man!"</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean&mdash;call a man?" cried Saginaw,
disgustedly. "Look a-here, you don't s'pose fer a
minute that if Gillum hadn't of got the old man's
pile he'd of loant him no hundred dollars, do ye?
How's he ever goin' to pay it back? Gillum knows,
an' everyone knows that's got any sense, that what
huntin' an' fishin' an' trappin' that old man kin do
ain't only goin' to make him a livin', at the best.
He ain't never goin' to git enough ahead to pay
back no hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"So much the more credit to Gillum, then.
What he did was to dig down and give him a hundred."</p>

<p>"Give him a hundred! An' well he could afford
to, seein' how he kep' thirty-four hundred fer himself.
Don't you think fer a minute, kid, that any
one that's low-down enough to blackguard a man
like Hurley would give away a hundred dollars&mdash;he'd
see a man starve first. It's plain as the nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
on yer face. We've got a clear case, an' I'm a-goin'
to git out a search warrant ag'in' him, 'fore
he gits a chanct to send that money out of the
woods. He's got it, an' I know it!"</p>

<p>Connie smiled broadly. "He must have got it
while we were at supper, then."</p>

<p>Saginaw regarded him curiously. "What d'ye
mean&mdash;supper?" he asked.</p>

<p>For answer the boy crossed to his bunk, and,
reaching into his turkey, drew out the soggy package.
"Do you know who Corky Dyer is?" he
asked, with seeming irrelevance.</p>

<p>"Sure, I know who Corky Dyer is&mdash;an' no good
of him, neither. He lives in Brainard, an' many's
the lumberjack that's the worse off fer knowin'
him. But, what's Corky Dyer got to do with Mike
Gillum an' the old man's money?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, with Mike Gillum. I was only
thinking I hope Corky can keep his feet warm
this winter, I sent him down a nice pair of wool
socks today."</p>

<p>Saginaw bent closer, and stared at the boy intently.
"Be ye feelin' all right, son?" he asked,
with genuine concern.</p>

<p>"Sure, I feel fine. As I was going on to say, Slue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Foot felt sorry for Corky Dyer's feet, so he picked
out a pair of nice warm socks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thought ye said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boy ignored the interruption, "and gave
them to Frenchy to send to Corky by express.
When Frenchy stopped here for his list I happened
to pick up the package and while I was looking at
it my foot slipped and I dropped it in a mud puddle
and then fell on it. I hated to think of poor
Corky wearing those dirty wet socks, and I didn't
want Frenchy to get an awful bawling out from
Slue Foot for not taking care of his package, so I
just took a new pair out of the wanagan and
sent them to him. I guess, now, we'd better
open this package and wring these wet ones out,
or they'll spoil."</p>

<p>Saginaw continued to stare as the boy drew his
knife and cut the cord. Then he exploded angrily:
"What in thunder d'ye s'pose I care about Corky
Dyer's socks? An' what's his socks got to do with
gittin' old Denny O'Sullivan's money back fer him?
I thought ye was a better sport than that&mdash;Ye
see yer fine friend's got cornered, an' right away ye
switch off an' begin talkin' about Slue Foot, an'
Frenchy, an' Corky Dyer's wet socks! Fer my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
part, Corky Dyer's feet could git wet an' froze fer
six foot above 'em&mdash;an' it would be a good thing
fer the timber country, at that!"</p>

<p>As Saginaw raved on, Connie unrolled the grey
woollen socks and smoothed them out upon his
knee. Saginaw watched, scowling disapproval as
he talked. "They's somethin' in one of 'em," he
said with sudden interest. "What's it got in
it?"</p>

<p>Connie regarded him gravely. "I don't know,
for sure&mdash;I haven't looked, but I think maybe it's
Denny O'Sullivan's missing bills."</p>

<p>Saginaw Ed's jaw dropped, and his hands
gripped the chair arms till the knuckles whitened,
as the boy thrust his hand into the damp sock.
"Yes, that's what it is, all right," he said, as he
drew forth the missing bills. "They're not quite
as new and clean, maybe, as they were, but they're
the ones&mdash;see the little notches in the corners, just
like the marks on his traps."</p>

<p>Saginaw stared in silence while the boy finished
counting: "&mdash;five, six, seven." Then, as full
realization dawned upon him, he burst forth, and
the roars of his laughter filled the little log office.
"Well, dog my cats!" he howled, when at length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
he found his voice. "'My foot slipped,' says he,
'an' I dropped it in a mud puddle an' fell on it!'"
He reached over and pounded the boy on the back
with a huge hand. "You doggone little cuss!
Here you set all the time, with the missin' bills
tucked away safe an' sound in yer turkey&mdash;an' me
trompin' my legs off tryin' to find out what's became
of 'em!" He thrust out his hand. "Ye
sure outguessed me, kid, an' I don't begrudge it.
When it comes to headwork, yer the captain&mdash;with
a capital K. An' believe me! I'd give a hull
lot to be where I could see Corky Dyer's face when
he unwrops that package of socks!"</p>

<p>Connie laughed. "So you see," he said, as he
shook the extended hand, "we've got a clear case,
all right&mdash;but not against Mike Gillum."</p>

<span class="smaller">HURLEY PREPARES FOR THE DRIVE</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HE</span> two camps on Dogfish hummed with activity.
Both Saginaw Ed and Slue Foot Magee
had their crews "laying 'em down" with an efficiency
that delighted the heart of Hurley, who came
into the little office of Camp One after an inspection
of the rollways, fairly radiating approval and
good humour. That evening around the roaring
stove the big walking boss lighted his pipe, and
tilting back in his chair, contentedly wriggled his
toes in the woollen socks, cocked comfortably upon
the edge of his bunk, the while he held forth upon
the merits of his crews to Lon Camden and Saginaw
Ed and Connie Morgan who shared the
quarters with him:</p>

<p>"The best crews ever went into the woods!" he
began, "barrin' none. I've logged from Westconsin
to the coast, an' never I seen the like. It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
partly because the men is doin' what they never
thought to be doin' again&mdash;layin' down white
pine. An' it's partly the bosses, an' the cook, an'
the scaler, an' the clerk. I'll show the owner a
profit this year that'll make him fergit last year's
loss like a busted shoestring. I've twict as many
logs on the rollways of each camp as I had altogether
last year."</p>

<p>Lon Camden shook his head: "Yeh, that's so,
Hurley, but logs on the rollways ain't logs at the
mills. Ye had enough banked along the river last
year to show a good profit&mdash;an' ye can bet yer last
dollar the Syndicate's foulin' our drive wasn't no
accident."</p>

<p>"But our brands was on the logs," insisted
Hurley. "Even the Syndicate wouldn't dare to
saw branded logs."</p>

<p>The scaler shook his head doubtfully: "I do'no,
boss, some one sawed 'em. To my certain knowledge
there was better than two million feet on the
landin's when we broke 'em out&mdash;an' two million
feet of white pine ort to showed a good profit."</p>

<p>Hurley nodded, glumly: "Sure it ort," he
agreed. "I seen the logs myself on the rollways,
an' when they got to the mills, the boom scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
was&mdash;" The big boss paused and scratched his
head thoughtfully, "&mdash;well, I ain't got no noodle
fer figgers, an' I disremember jest what it was, but
it was short enough so it et up the profits an'
handed us a fourteen-thousan'-dollar loss, or thereabouts.
An' me with the owner way up in Alasky,
an' thinkin' mebbe I done him out of his money.
'Twas a long head I had when I stuck out fer a
two-year contrack, an' this year if we don't roll
eight million feet in the river my name ain't Jake
Hurley!"</p>

<p>"Yes," broke in Saginaw Ed, "an' if we make
the same rate of loosin', the loss this year'll figger
somewheres up around fifty thousan'."</p>

<p>Hurley's eyes grew hard "They ain't a-goin'
to be no loss this year!" he replied savagely. "The
Syndicate had more logs in Dogfish than me last
year, an' a bigger crew, an' more white-water
birlers amongst 'em, so Long Leaf Olson, the foreman
of the Syndicate camp, ordered me to take
the rear drive. I tuk it&mdash;an' be the time I'd got
through cardin' the ledges, an' sackin' the bars, an'
shovin' off jill-pokes, the main drive was sorted an'
the logs in the logans, an' I was handed me boom
scale at the mills. But, this year it's different.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
I'll have agin as many logs as them, an' two crews,
an' when we git to the mills I'll have men of my
own at the sortin' gap."</p>

<p>"If they was dams on Dogfish the rear drive
wouldn't be so bad," opined Saginaw.</p>

<p>"If they was dams on Dogfish, we'd be worse off
than ever," growled Hurley, "because the Syndicate
would own the dams, an' we'd stand a fat
show of sluicin' anything through 'em. No sir!
We'll go out with the ice, an' me on the head of the
drive, an' if Long Leaf fouls us, I won't be carin'.
I see through the game he done me last year&mdash;keepin'
me on the rear, an' it worked like this:
Dogfish runs out with a rush an' then falls as quick
as it run out. All the logs that ain't into the big
river on the run-out is left fer the rear drive, an',
believe me, we had a plenty dry-rollin' to do. For
why? Because that thievin' Long Leaf nipped
every jam before it started, an' left me with a
month's work gittin' the stranded logs out of Dogfish.
This year, it'll be me that's boss of the main
drive, an' if a jam starts I'll let 'em pile up&mdash;an'
I'll see that one starts, too&mdash;that'll back the water
up behind 'em an' give the rear plenty of river to
float down on, then when everything's caught up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
I'll put some canned thunder in under her an'
away we go to the next jam."</p>

<p>"Ye' talk like ye could jam 'em whenever ye
wanted to," said Lon Camden.</p>

<p>Hurley regarded him gravely: "It's twenty-three
miles from here to the big river. There'll
be a jam ten miles below here, an' another, one
mile above the mouth." The three stared at him
in surprise. "You see," the boss continued, with
evident satisfaction in their astonishment, "when
I got the boom scale last summer, it turned me sick.
I made out me report an' sent it to Alasky, an'
then I went home to Pine Hook an' hoed me garden
a day, an' put in the next one choppin' firewood.
It was after supper that day an' the kiddies
to bed, the wife comes out to where I was an' sets
down on the choppin' log beside me. I smokes
me pipe, an' don't pay her no mind, 'cause I was
sore in the heart of me. After while she lays a
hand on the sleeve of me shirt. 'Jake,' she says,
'all the winter an' spring the childer gabbles about
the fun they'll be havin' when daddy comes
home.'" The man paused and grinned, slyly.
"It's like a woman to begin at the backwards of a
thing an' work up to the front. I bet when one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
gits to heaven it'll be the health of Adam an' Eve
they'll be inquirin' about furst, instead of John
L. Sullivan, roight out. Anyway, that's what she
says, an' I replies in the negative by sayin' nothin'.
'An' here you be'n home two days,' she goes on,
an' stops, like they's enough be'n said.</p>

<p>"'An' I've hoed the garden, an' cut the firewood,'
says I. 'What would you be havin' me
do?'" Again Hurley grinned: "I dropped a
match in the bung of an empty gasoline bar'l onct,
that had laid in the sun behind the store, thinkin'
to see if it would make a good rain bar'l. It
didn't. Part of it made fair kindlin's, though, an'
I was out an' around in a week. Giant powder,
gasoline, an' wimmin is all safe enough if ye don't
handle 'em careless&mdash;but, if ye do, ye git quick
action&mdash;an' plenty of it.</p>

<p>"'Do!' she says, in the same tone of voice used
by the gasoline bar'l that day. 'Well, if you can't
think of nothin' else to do, give the poor darlints
a beatin' just to let 'em know you're around!'
Then she gits up an' starts fer the house." Hurley
held a match to his pipe and puffed deeply for a few
moments, "I never believed much in signs," he
grinned, "but they's some signs I heed&mdash;so I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
laughed. The laugh come from the throat only,
an' not from the heart, an' at the sound of it she
turned, an' then she come back slow an' set down
agin on the choppin' log. 'Tell me what's wrong,
Jake,' she says. 'Two kin carry a load better than
one.' So I up an' told her, an' she set for quite a
while an' looked out over the slashin'.</p>

<p>"'Is that all?' she says, after a bit. 'Is that
what ye've be'n hoein' an' choppin' over fer two
days, an' gittin' madder with every whack&mdash;an'
not payin' no heed to the important things that's
been pilin' up to be done.' 'What's to be done?'
says I, 'if it ain't the wood an' the garden?' 'It's
the first time ye ever come back from the woods an'
didn't see fer yerself what's to be done,' she says.
'With two wheels busted off Jimmy's tote wagon,
an' Paddy's logs in the crick an' on his landin's
waitin' fer daddy to show him how to build his dam
an' sluice, an' Jimmy with the timber all out fer his
Injun stockade, an' waitin' fer daddy to tell him
does the logs go in crossways or up an' down!'</p>

<p>"So the next week I put in loggin' on the crick
behind the pig pen. We put in a dam an' sluice,
an' run a season's cut through, an' sorted 'em an'
boomed 'em, an even rigged a goat-power saw-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>mill
that would jerk the logs out of the crick but
wouldn't cut 'em. An' by gosh, when the week
was gone I had some good schemes in me own head,
an' takin' five men with me, I went off up Dogfish
an' studied the stream, an' this spring they'll be
jams where I want jams! An' I'm the bucko that'll
be on the head end, an' I'll bust 'em when I want
to!"</p>

<p>"You ain't obstructed navigation, have ye?"
asked Lon, with concern. "Cause if you have the
Syndicate'll take it up in a minute, an' they'll law
ye out of ten seasons' profit. Buckin' the Syndicate
has cost many a little feller his pile. If
they can't steal ye poor, they'll law ye poor&mdash;an'
it's the same thing fer the small operator."</p>

<p>"Never you fret about the lawin', Lon. What
I an' me five hearties put into Dogfish last summer
looks like drift piles from a summer rain, an' the
same charge of canned thunder that busts the
jam will blow the log-an' rock foundations of
the drift piles to smithereens."</p>

<p>Lon smoked in silence for a few moments, as
though pondering the boss's words, and as he
smoked his lips gradually expanded into a grin of
approval. Hurley noted the smile: "An' it all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
come of me workin' out the problems of a six-year
old kid on the little crick behind the pig
pen. An' what's more, I've got some of the
problems of the big river more clear in me
noodle."</p>

<p>Saginaw Ed winked at Connie; and leaning over,
whispered into the boy's ear: "Hurley's done a
smart thing," he confided, "an' it'll hurry the drive
out of Dogfish. But he ain't got to the meat of
the trouble&mdash;an' that's up to you an' me."</p>

<p>As the season progressed Hurley had increased
his crews until each numbered one hundred and
twenty-five men, and the daily work of these men
was an unceasing source of interest to Connie.
Every moment that could be spared from his
duties, the boy was out among them, swinging an
axe with the swampers, riding the huge loads of
logs that slipped smoothly over the iced log roads
on their trips to the landings, standing beside Lon
Camden as he scaled the incoming loads, or among
the sawyers, watching some mighty pine crash to
earth with a roar of protest.</p>

<p>"I never seen a clerk before that ye could prize
away from the office stove with a pickpole," remarked
Lon Camdon, one day, as he and Hurley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
watched the boy riding toward them balanced
upon the top log of a huge load.</p>

<p>"He'll know more about loggin' be spring," replied
the boss, "than many an' old lumberjack.
It's the makin' of a fine boss the kid has."</p>

<p>"He kin scale as good as me, a'ready," admitted
Lon. "An' that other kid, too&mdash;why just from
trottin' 'round with this one he's got so he shows
some real stuff. If ever I picked a kid fer a bad
egg it was him."</p>

<p>"Me too," admitted Hurley. "But Connie
stuck up for him, even after he'd throw'd in with
the I. W. W's. Steve kin have anything I've
got," he added, after a pause. "He saved me life,
an' after the drive I'm goin' to take him home with
me up to Pine Hook, instead of turnin' him loose to
go to the bad around such dumps as Corky Dyer's
where I picked him up. He'd got a wrong start.
It's like he was follerin' a log road, an' got switched
off onto a cross-haul&mdash;but, he's back on the main
road again, an' it's Jake Hurley'll keep him
there."</p>

<p>"He's all right, an' the men like him&mdash;but he
ain't got the head the other one has."</p>

<p>"Sure he ain't!" agreed Hurley. "You kin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
take it from me, Lon, before that there Connie is
thirty, he'll be ownin' timber of his own."</p>

<p>"I'd almost bet money on it," said Saginaw Ed,
who had come up in time to hear Hurley's prophecy.
"Say boss, them irons come in fer the
cook's bateau; I expect we better put to work on
it. Month from now, an' we'll be listenin' night
an' day fer the boomin' of the ice."</p>

<p>The boss assented: "Hop to it, fer we don't
want no delay when this drive starts."</p>

<p>Saginaw turned toward the blacksmith shop to
give his orders regarding the scow, in which the
cook would follow the drive and furnish hot meals
for the rivermen. His eye fell upon Connie as the
boy slid from the load: "Better get over to the
office, son," he grinned. "Slue Foot's over there
just a-meltin' the snow, 'cause you ain't around to
sell him a plug of terbacker." The boy joined
him, and Saginaw cast a look at the rollways:
"Lots of logs on the landin's, son," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Seven million, three hundred thousand feet,
up to last night," said the boy proudly. "Everything
looks fine."</p>

<p>"Fine as frog hair, son&mdash;which some folks holds
is too fine to last."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well nothin' that I could name&mdash;only, what
you said about Slue Foot's bein' mixed up with the
I. W. W. It's like I told you, them birds gits jobs
just so they kin git a chanct to distroy property.
They don't want to work, an' they don't want no
one else to work. We caught three of 'em tryin'
to burn the stables, which is about their size, an'
if the sheriff served Doc's warrants, I guess they're
in jail now. But how do we know that them three
was <i>all</i> the I. W. W.'s in the outfit? An' how do
we know that Slue Foot ain't plottin' some move
that'll put a crimp in us somehow er other?"</p>

<p>The boy smiled: "I've thought of that, too,"
he answered. "But I don't think there is much
danger from the I. W. W.'s. I've been watching
Slue Foot, and I know that he's not going to start
anything. He was glad to get those I. W. W.'s off
the works. You see he's got a fish of his own to
fry. He belongs to the I. W. W. just because it's
natural for him to throw in with crooks and criminals,
but he's so crooked himself that he won't
even play square with his gang of crooks. He saw
a chance to make some crooked money for himself,
so he threw his friends over. We're all right, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>cause
the more logs we put into the river the bigger
his graft is. And we've got him right where we
want him. We can nail him in a minute, if we
want to, for swiping the old Irishman's money&mdash;but
I don't want to spring that unless I have to
until I get the goods on the Syndicate."</p>

<p>Saginaw nodded: "I guess that's good dope,
all right. But, if I was you, I'd git a line on his
scheme as soon as I could. You can't never tell
what'll happen in the woods&mdash;an' when it does,
it's most generally always somethin' different."</p>

<p>As the boy continued his way to the office, after
parting from Saginaw at the blacksmith shop, he
decided to carry out Saginaw's suggestion at once.
In fact, for a week or ten days Connie had been
watching for an opportunity to force Slue Foot to
show his hand. And now he decided, the time had
come. There was no one in sight; the boss of
Camp Two had evidently gone into the office.</p>

<h2 class="subhead"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />

<span class="smaller">SLUE FOOT "COMES ACROSS"</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="dropleftmax">S</span> Connie pushed open the door he was greeted
with a growl: "It's a doggone wonder ye
wouldn't stay 'round an' tend to business onct in
a while! Here I be'n waitin' half an' hour fer to
git a plug of terbacker, an' you off kihootin' 'round
the woods&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Save your growling, 'til someone's round to
hear it," grinned the boy, as he produced the key
to the chest. "Here's your tobacco, twenty cents'
worth&mdash;makes thirty-two dollars and sixty cents,
all told."</p>

<p>"Thirty-two sixty!" Slue Foot glared: "Thought
Hurley's outfits never gouged the men on the
wanagan?" he sneered. "My tab ain't over
twenty-five dollars at the outside."</p>

<p>"Get it out of your system," retorted the boy.
"You can't bluff me. Thirty-two sixty's down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
here. Thirty-two sixty's right&mdash;and you know
it's right! What's on your mind? You didn't
walk clear down from Camp Two for a twenty-cent
plug of tobacco, when you've got the biggest
part of a carton in your turkey."</p>

<p>With his back to the stove, the boss scowled at
the boy! "Smart kid, ain't you?" The scowl
faded from his face, an' he repeated: "Smart
kid&mdash;an' that's why I tuk a notion to ye, an'&mdash;'"
he paused abruptly and crossing to the window,
took a position that commanded the clearing.
"&mdash;an' let ye in on some extry money."</p>

<p>Connie nodded: "Yes, and it's about time you
were loosening up on the proposition&mdash;you haven't
let me in yet."</p>

<p>"Ain't let ye in!" exclaimed Slue Foot. "What
ye mean, 'ain't let ye in'? How about shadin'
the cut?"</p>

<p>"Shading the cut," exclaimed the boy, with
contempt. "What's a couple of hundred dollars?
That's a piker's job&mdash;Injun stealing! You promised
to let me in on something big&mdash;now, come
across."</p>

<p>Slue Foot stared at him: "Say, who's runnin'
this, you? Yer all-fired cocky fer a kid. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
was your age a couple hundred dollars looked big
as a township o' timber to me."</p>

<p>"Well, it don't to me," snapped the boy. "And
you might as well come across."</p>

<p>Slue Foot advanced one threatening step:
"Who d'ye think ye're talkin' to?" he roared.
"I'll break ye in two!"</p>

<p>"And when I break, you break," smiled the
boy. "Let me tell you this, Slue Foot Magee,
I've got these books fixed so that if anything happens
to me, your nose goes under, and all that's
left is a string of bubbles&mdash;see? I've been doing
some figuring lately, and I've decided the time's
about right for me to get in on the other. According
to the talk, it will be twenty or thirty days yet
before the break-up. But, suppose the break-up
should come early this year&mdash;early and sudden?
You'd have your hands full and couldn't waste
time on me. And besides you'd never let me in
then, anyway. You're only letting me in because
I'm supposed to furnish the dope on what's going
on here. I'm playing safe&mdash;see the point?"</p>

<p>Slue Foot glowered: "An' what if I've changed
my mind about lettin' ye in?" he asked truculently.</p>

<p>"Oh, then I'll just naturally sell your cut-shad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>ing
scheme out to Hurley and his boss for what I
can get&mdash;and let you stand the gaff."</p>

<p>Slue Foot's fists clenched, a big vein stood out
upon his reddened forehead, and he seemed to
swell visibly: "You&mdash;you'd double-cross me,
would you?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I would," said the boy, "if you don't
come through. Look here, Slue Foot, business is
business. I wouldn't trust you as far as I can
throw a saw log, and you may as well get that right
now."</p>

<p>"How do I know you won't double-cross me on
the big deal?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Matter of figures," answered Connie. "You
don't suppose Hurley and his boss would pay me
as much as we can get out of the logs do you?
Of course they won't&mdash;but they might agree to
pay me as much as I'll get out of the cut-shading&mdash;especially
if I tell them that you've got a bigger
game up your sleeve. You might as well be reasonable.
It'll be better all around if you and I
understand each other. They're beginning to talk
in here about the drive. If I don't know what
your scheme is, how am I to know what to remember?
I can't remember everything they say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and if I'm onto the game I can pick out what'll do
us good, and not bother with the rest."</p>

<p>Once more Slue Foot took up his place by the
window, and for some minutes the only sound in
the little office was the ticking of the alarm clock.
Finally the man spoke: "I figgered you was
smart all right&mdash;smarter'n the run of kids. But
I didn't figger you could out-figger me&mdash;or believe
me, I'd of laid off of ye." The boss of Camp Two
sat and scowled at the boy for several minutes.
Then he spoke, sullenly at first, but as he warmed
to his topic, the sullenness gave place to a sort of
crafty enthusiasm&mdash;a fatuous pride in his cleverly
planned scheme of fraud. "I was goin' to let ye in
anyhow, so I s'pose it might's well be now as later.
But, git this, right on the start: ye ain't bluffed me
into takin' ye in, an' ye ain't scared me into it.
You've augered me into it by common sense ...
what ye said about they might come a sudden
thaw, an' we'd be too busy to git together&mdash;an'
about you knowin' what to remember of the talk
that goes on here.</p>

<p>"It's like this: The logs is paint-branded, an'
the mark of this outfit is the block-an'-ball in red
on the butt end. They're branded on the landin's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
an' I done the markin' myself. Last year Hurley
inspected 'em an' so did Lon, an' they know the
brands showed up big an' bright an' sassy. But
when them logs reached the booms an' was sorted
they wasn't near as many of them wearin' the red
block-an'-ball as when they started&mdash;an' the difference
is what I split up with the Syndicate&mdash;boom-toll
free!"</p>

<p>"You mean," asked the boy, "that the Syndicate
men changed the brands, or painted them out
and painted their own over them?"</p>

<p>Slue Foot sneered. "Ye're pretty smart&mdash;some
ways. But ye ain't smart enough to change
a red block-an'-ball to a green tripple X. An' as
fer paintin' over 'em, why if a log hit the big river
with a brand painted out they'd be a howl go up
that would rock the big yaller ball on top of the
capital. No sir, it takes brains to make money
loggin'. The big ones has stole and grabbed up
into the millions&mdash;an' they do it accordin' to law&mdash;because
they've got the money to make the law
an' twist it to suit theirselves. They put up
thousands fer lobbys an' legislaters, an' fer judges
an' juries, an' they drag down millions. The
whole timber game's a graft. The big operators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
grab water rights, an' timber rights, an' they even
grab the rivers. An' they do it legal because they
own the dummies that makes the laws. The
little operator ain't got no show. If he don't
own his own timber he has to take what he can get
in stumpage contracks, an' whether he owns it or
not they git him on water-tolls, an' when he hits
the river there's boom-tolls an' sortin'-tolls, an' by
the time he's got his logs to the mills an' sold accordin'
to the boom scale he ain't got nawthin'
left, but his britches&mdash;an' lucky to have them.
All business is crooked. If everyone was honest
they wouldn't be no millionaires. If a man's got
a million, he's a crook. It ain't no worse fer us
little ones to steal agin' the law, than it is fer the
big ones to steal accordin' to law." Fairly started
upon his favourite theme, Slue Foot worked himself
into a perfect rage as he ranted on. "This here
outfit's a little outfit," he continued. "It ain't got
no show, nohow. I seen the chanct to git in on the
graft an' I grabbed it&mdash;if I hadn't, the Syndicate
would have had it all. An' besides I got a chance to
git square with Hurley. They's two kinds of folks
in the world&mdash;them that has, an' them that hain't.
Them that has, has because they've retch out an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
grabbed, an' them that hain't, hain't because they
wasn't smart enough to hang onto what they did
have." Connie listened with growing disgust to
the wolfish diatribe. Slue Foot's eyes blazed as he
drove his yellow fangs deep into his tobacco plug.
"But people's wakin' up to their rights," he continued.
"There's the Socialists an' the I. W. W.'s,
they're partly right, an' partly wrong. The Socialists
wants, as near as I kin make out, a equal distribution
o' wealth&mdash;that ain't so bad, except that
there's only a few of 'em, an' they'd be doin' all the
work to let a lot of others that don't do nawthin',
in on their share of the dividin'. What's the use
of me a-workin' so someone else that don't help
none gits a equal share? An' the I. W. W.'s is
about as bad. They try to bust up everything,
an' wreck, an' smash, an' tear down&mdash;that's all
right, fer as it goes&mdash;but, what's it goin' to git 'em?
Where do they git off at? They ain't figgered
themselves into no profit by what they do. What's
it goin' to git me if I burn down a saw-mill? I
don't git the mill, do I? No&mdash;an' neither don't
they. What I'm after is gittin' it off them that's
got it, an' lettin' it stick to me. I ain't worryin'
about no one else. It's every man fer hisself&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>an'
I'm fer <i>me!</i>" The boss prodded himself in the
chest, as he emphasized the last word. "An' if you
want yourn, you'd better stick with me&mdash;we'll
gather."</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that Connie masked the
loathing he felt for this man whose creed was more
despicable even than the creed of the organized
enemies of society, for Slue Foot unhesitatingly
indorsed all their viciousness, but discarded even
their lean virtues.</p>

<p>For three years the boy's lot had been cast
among men&mdash;rough men of the great outland.
He had known good men and bad men, but never
had he known a man whom he so utterly despised
as this Slue Foot Magee. The bad men he had
know were defiant in their badness, they flaunted
the law to its face&mdash;all except Mr. Squigg, who
was a sneak with the heart of a weasel, and didn't
count. But this man, as bad as the worst of them,
sought to justify his badness. Connie knew what
Waseche Bill, or big MacDougall would have done
if this human wolf had sought to persuade them
to throw in with him on his dirty scheme, and he
knew what Hurley or Saginaw Ed would do&mdash;and
unconsciously, the boy's fists doubled. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
came the memory of McKeever and Ricky, the
men of the Mounted with whom he had worked in
the bringing of bad men to justice. What would
McKeever do? The boy's fists relaxed. "He'd
get him," he muttered under his breath. "He'd
throw in with him, and find out all he could find
out, and then he'd&mdash;<i>get him!</i>"</p>

<p>"Whut's that?" Slue Foot asked the question
abruptly, and Connie faced him with a grin:</p>

<p>"Your dope sounds good to me," he said, "but
come across with the scheme. Hurley or Saginaw
may drop in here any time. If the Syndicate
didn't change the brands, or paint over them, how
did they work it?"</p>

<p>"They didn't work it&mdash;it was me that worked it.
All they done was to furnish me the paint an' put
their own marks on the logs after I'd got 'em into
the big river, brand free. It's this way: Brandin'
paint will stand water. You kin paint-brand a log
here an' the brand will still be on it if it floats clean
to New Orleans. That's the kind of paint Hurley
furnished. An' that's the kind of paint that went
on some of the logs. But another kind went on
the rest of the logs. It was just as red an' just
as purty lookin' as the other&mdash;while the logs stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
on the rollways. After they'd b'en in the water
a while they wasn't no paint on 'em. German
chemists mixed that paint&mdash;an' water'll take it
off, like it'll take dirt offen a floor&mdash;easier 'cause
you don't have to use no soap, an' you don't have
to do no scrubbin'&mdash;it jest na'chelly melts an'
floats off. Hurley bossed the rear end drive, an'
when our crews got to the mills, the Syndicate had
saw to it that all unbranded logs was took care of
an' wore the green tripple X."</p>

<p>Connie nodded and Slue Foot continued:
"Pretty slick, eh? But they's more to it than that.
It's got to be worked right. I had to slip Long
Leaf Olson the word when the rollways would be
busted out so he could foul our drive an' git his logs
in on the head end. Then, there was the dickerin'
with the Syndicate. It took some rammin' around
before I got next to old Heinie Metzger&mdash;he's the
big boss of the Syndicate. I worked it through
passin' myself off fer Hurley to a stuck-up young
whipper-snapper name of von Kuhlmann, that's old
Heinie's side-kick&mdash;confidential secretary, he calls
him. Them Germans is slick, but at last we got
together an' made the deal, an' they paid me all
right, boom scale, when the logs was in. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
here von Kuhlmann hisself slipped me the money&mdash;he's
a funny galoot, always swelled up an' blowin'
like he owned the world, an' always noddin' an'
winkin', like they was somethin' he was holdin'
out on ye, as if he know'd somethin' that no one
else know'd&mdash;an' brag! You'd ort to hear him
brag about Germany, like they wasn't no other
reg'lar country, the rest of the world just bein' a
kind of place that wasn't hardly worth mentionin'.
They say the Syndicate stock is all owned in Germany,
an' some of the cruisers that's worked fer
'em say it's a sight the amount of stuff they make
'em put in their reports. Accordin' to his job a
cruiser or a land-looker is supposed to estimate
timber. But the cruisers that works fer the Syndicate
is supposed to report on everything from the
number of box cars an' engines on the railroads,
to the size of the towns, an' the number of folks in
'em that's Socialists an' I. W. W.'s. an' their name.
They don't care nawthin about wastin' postage
stamps, neither, 'cause all that stuff is sent over to
Germany. What do they care over in the old
country how many box cars is on some little old
branch loggin' road in the timber country, or how
many I. W. W.'s. lives in Thief River Falls?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"An speakin' of I. W. W.'s&mdash;them Germans is
slick some ways, an' blamed fools in another.
With the I. W. W.'s. threatenin' the timber interests,
these here Germans, that owns more mills an'
standin' timber than any one else, is eggin' 'em on
an' slippin' 'em money to keep 'em goin'. The
I. W. W.'s., don't know that&mdash;an' I wouldn't neither
except fer a lucky accident, an' I cashed in on it,
too." The man paused and grinned knowingly.
"In Duluth, it was, we pulled off a meetin' right
under the nose of the police, an' not one of 'em in
the hall. Called it a Socialist meetin', an' word
was passed that they was a feller name of Mueller,
from Germany, a student that was wised up to
every wrinkle from blowin' up dams to wipin' out
the Government. He come with greetin's from
the 'brothers acrost the sea,' he said, an' what was
more to the point, he brung along a nice fat package
of cash money which he claimed had be'n
raised by subscription fer to help the cause over
here. I listened an' kep' a studyin' about where
I'd saw this here Mueller before, but it didn't stand
to reason I had, an' him just over from Germany.
But they was somethin' about him made me sure
I know'd him. He was dressed cheap an' wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
glasses half an inch thick, an' they hadn't no barber
be'n into his hair fer quite a spell; he'd needed
a shave fer about three weeks, too, an' he looked
like a reg'lar b'ilin' out wouldn't of hurt him none.
Anyways, before the meetin' was over, I'd spotted
him, so 'long about midnight, after the meetin'
had be'n over about an hour I loafs down to the
hotel. It was a cheap dump, a hang-out fer
lumberjacks an' lake sailors, an' I know'd the
clerk an' didn't have no trouble gittin' to his room.</p>

<p>"'Hello, von Kuhlmann,' I says, when he opens
the door, an' with a wild look up an' down the hall
to see if any one had heard, he reaches out an' yanks
me in. Tried to bluff it out first, but it wasn't no
use." Slue Foot grinned: "I come out in about
a half an hour with five hundred dollars in my
jeans. These here 'brothers from acrost the sea'
is sure some donaters when you git 'em where you
want 'em&mdash;'course this here student business was
all bunk. But, what I ain't never be'n able to git
onto is, what in thunder does the Syndicate want
to be slippin' the I. W. W. money fer?"</p>

<p>"Are you an I. W. W.?" Connie shot the
question directly.</p>

<p>Slue Foot hesitated a moment and then answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
evasively. "Git me right, kid, I'm anything that's
agin' capital&mdash;an' I'm anything that's agin' the
Government. First and foremostly, I'm fer Magee.
No man kin make money by workin'. I've
got money, an' I'm a-goin' to git more&mdash;an' I
don't care how it's come by. I'm a wolf, an' I'll
howl while the rabbit squeals! I'm a bird of prey!
I'm a Government all my own! All Governments
is birds of prey, an' beasts of prey. What do you
see on their money, an' their seals, an' their flags&mdash;doves,
an' rabbits, an' little fawns? No, it's
eagles, an' bears, an' lions&mdash;beasts that rips, an'
tears, an' crushes, an' kills!</p>

<p>"You're lucky to git to throw in with a man
like me&mdash;to git started out right when yer young.
If you wasn't smart, I wouldn't fool with ye, but
I'll git mine, an' you'll git yourn&mdash;an' some day,
von Kuhlmann's kind of let it slip, they's somethin'
big comin' off. I don't know what he's drivin' at,
but it's somethin' he's all-fired sure is a-goin' to
happen&mdash;an' he's kind of hinted that when it
comes he kin use a few like me to good advantage."</p>

<p>"What kind of a thing's coming off?"</p>

<p>"I jest told ye I don't know&mdash;mebbe the Syndicate's
goin' to grab off all the timber they is, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
mebbe it's figgerin' on grabbin' the hull Government,
or the State&mdash;but whatever it is, he kin
count on me bein' in on it&mdash;if he pays enough&mdash;an'
by the time he pays it, I'd ort to know enough
about the game so's I kin flop over to the other side
an' sell him out. It's the ones that plays both
ends from the middle that gits theirn&mdash;brains
makes the money&mdash;not hands."</p>

<p>Slue Foot glanced out the window and turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the boy. "Here comes Saginaw. When he gits
here I'll growl an' you sass. Remember to keep
your ears open an' find out when Hurley's goin'
to break out the rollways, an' where he's goin' to
deliver the logs. I've tended to the brandin'&mdash;if
they's anything more I'll let ye know." Slue
Foot paused and scowled darkly: "An' don't try
to double-cross me! They ain't nothin' I've told
ye that ye could prove anyhow. An' even if ye
could, it's just as you said, this outfit won't pay
ye as much as what you'll git out of the deal by
playin' square with me."</p>

<p>The door opened and Saginaw Ed entered, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
interrupt a perfect torrent of abuse from Slue Foot,
and a rapid fire of recrimination from the boy.
Presently the boss of Camp Two departed, threatening
to have Connie fired for incompetence, as
soon as he could get in a word with Hurley.</p>

<span class="caption">SLUE FOOT TURNED. "THINK Y'RE AWFUL SMART, DON'T YE?"</span>
</div>

<p>On the tote road at the edge of the clearing,
Slue Foot turned and gazed at the little office.
And as he gazed an evil smile twisted his lips:
"Think yer awful smart, don't ye? Well, yer in
on the scheme&mdash;'cause I need ye in. An' I'll use
ye fer all there is in ye&mdash;but when cashin'-in time
comes, yer goin' to be left whistlin' fer yourn&mdash;er
my name ain't Slue Foot Magee!" Then the
smile slowly faded from his face, and removing his
cap, he thoughtfully scratched his head. "Only
trouble is, he <i>is</i> smart&mdash;an' where'll I git off at, if
it turns out he's too <i>doggone</i> smart?"</p>

<span class="smaller">HEINIE METZGER</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">AGINAW ED</span> listened as Connie detailed at
length all that Slue Foot had told him.
When the boy finished, the woodsman removed
his pipe and regarded him thoughtfully: "Takin' it
off an' on, I've know'd some consider'ble ornery
folks in my time, but I never run acrost none that
was as plumb crooked as this here specimen. Why,
along side of him a corkscrew is straight as a
stretched fiddle gut. He ain't square with no one.
But, a man like him can't only go so far&mdash;his rope
is short, an' when he comes to the end of it, they
ain't a-goin' to be no knot fer to hang holt of.
A man that's double-crossed folks like he has ain't
got no right to expect to git away with it. If they
don't no one else git him, the law will."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the boy, "and we've got
enough on him so that when the law gets through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
with him he's not going to have much time left
for any more crookedness."</p>

<p>"How d'you figger on workin' it?" asked Saginaw.</p>

<p>Connie laughed: "I haven't had time to dope it
out yet, but there's no use starting anything 'til
just before the drive. Slue Foot's crowding 'em
up there in Camp Two, putting every last log he
can get onto the landings&mdash;he said he'd have close
to three million feet branded with his own paint."</p>

<p>"Expects Hurley's goin' to let Long Leaf boss
the drive agin, I s'pose an' the Syndicate crew
do the sortin'!"</p>

<p>"I guess that's what's he's counting on," answered
the boy. "Hurley will tend to that part.
And now we know his scheme, the logs are safe&mdash;what
we want is evidence. When we get him we
want to get him right."</p>

<p>Saginaw Ed rose to go. "It's up to you, son, to
figger out the best way. Whatever you say goes.
Take yer time an' figger it out good&mdash;'cause you
want to remember that the Syndicate owes ye
some thirty-odd thousand dollars they stoled off ye
last year, an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thirty-odd thousand?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;ye stood to clean up twenty thousan',
didn't ye? Instead of which ye lost fourteen
thousan'&mdash;that's thirty-four thousan', ain't it?
An' here's somethin' fer to remember when yer
dealin' with the Syndicate: Never law 'em if you
can git out of it. They've got the money&mdash;an'
you ain't got no square deal. Git the dope on
'em, an' then settle out o' court, with old Heinie
Metzger."</p>

<p>When Saginaw had gone, Connie sat for hours
at his desk thinking up plans of action, discarding
them, revising them, covering whole sheets of
paper with pencilled figures.</p>

<p>When, at last, he answered the supper call and
crossed the clearing to the cook's camp, a peculiar
smile twitched the corners of his lips.</p>

<p>"I've got to go up the road a piece an' figger on a
couple of new skidways," said Saginaw, when the
four who bunked in the office arose from the table.
"It's good an' moonlight, an' I kin git the swampers
started on 'em first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," decided the boy, "I've been
cooped up all the afternoon, and I'll be glad of the
chance to stretch my legs."</p>

<p>Leaving Hurley and Lon Camden, the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
struck off up one of the broad, iced log roads that
reached into the timber like long fingers clutching
at the very heart of the forest. The task of locating
the skidways was soon finished and Saginaw
seated himself on a log and produced pipe and
tobacco. "Well, son," he said, "what's the game?
I watched ye whilst we was eatin', an' I seen ye'd
got it figgered out."</p>

<p>After a moment of silence, Connie asked
abruptly: "How am I going to manage to get away
for a week or ten days?"</p>

<p>"Git away!" exclaimed Saginaw. "You mean
leave camp?"</p>

<p>The boy nodded: "Yes, I've got to go." He
seated himself astride the log and talked for an
hour, while Saginaw, his pipe forgotten, listened.
When the boy finished Saginaw sat in silence,
the dead pipe clenched between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it?"</p>

<p>The other removed the pipe, and spat deliberately
into the snow. "Think of it?" he replied, "I
never was much hand fer thinkin'&mdash;an' them big
figgers you're into has got me woozy headed. Personal
an' private, I'm tellin' ye right out, I don't
think it'll work. It sounds good the way you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
spoke it, but&mdash;why, doggone it, that would be
outfiggerin' the <i>Syndicate!</i> It would be lettin' 'em
beat theirself at their own game! It can't be did!
They ain't no one kin do it. It ain't on."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Matter with it! I can't find nothin' the
matter with it&mdash;That's why it won't work!"</p>

<p>Connie laughed: "We'll make it work! All
you've got to remember is that if any stranger
comes into the camp asking for Hurley, you steer
him up against Slue Foot. This von Kuhlmann
himself will probably come, and if he does it will
be all right&mdash;he knows Slue Foot by sight. The
only thing that's bothering me is how am I going
to ask Hurley for a week or ten days off? Frenchy's
going in tomorrow, and I've got to go with him."</p>

<p>Saginaw Ed slapped his mittened hand against
his leg: "I've got it," he exclaimed. "There was
three new hands come in today&mdash;good whitewater
men fer the drive. One of 'em's Quick-water
Quinn. I've worked with him off an' on fer it's
goin' on fifteen year. He'll do anything fer me,
account of a little deal onct, which he believed I
saved his life. I'll slip over to the men's camp an'
write a letter to you. Then later, when we're all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in the office, Quick-water, he'll fetch it over an'
ask if you're here, an' give it to ye. Then ye
read it, and take on like you've got to go right away
fer a week er so. You don't need to make any
explainin'&mdash;jest stick to it you've got to go.
Hurley'll prob'ly rave round an' tell ye ye can't,
an' bawl ye out, an' raise a rookus generally, but
jest stick to it. If it gits to where ye have to, jest
tell him you quit. That'll bring him 'round. He
sets a lot of store by you, an' he'll let ye go if
ye make him."</p>

<p>And so it happened that just as the four were
turning in that night, a lumberjack pushed open
the door. "Is they any one here name o' C.
Morgan?" he asked.</p>

<p>Connie stepped forward, and the man thrust a
letter into his hand: "Brung it in with me from the
postoffice. They told me over to the men's camp
you was in here."</p>

<p>Connie thanked the man, and carrying the letter
to the light, tore it open and read. At the end of
five minutes he looked up: "I've got to go out
with Frenchy in the morning," he announced.</p>

<p>Hurley let a heavy boot fall with a thud, and
stared at the boy as though he had taken leave of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
his senses. "Go out!" he roared, "What'ye
mean, go out?"</p>

<p>"I've got to go for a week or ten days. It's
absolutely necessary or I wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"A wake er tin days, sez he!" Hurley lapsed
into brogue, as he always did when aroused or
excited. "An' fer a wake or tin days the books kin
run theirsilf! Well, ye can't go&mdash;an' that's all
there is to ut!"</p>

<p>"I've got to go," repeated Connie stubbornly.
"If I don't go out with Frenchy, I'll walk out!"</p>

<p>The boss glared at him. "I know'd things wuz
goin' too good to last. But Oi didn't think th'
trouble wuz a-comin' from ye. Ye can tell me,
mebbe, what, Oi'm a-goin' to do widout no clerk
whoilst yer gaddin' round havin' a good toime?
Ye can't go!"</p>

<p>"Steve can run the wanagan, and Lon, and Saginaw,
and Slue Foot can hold their reports 'til I
get back. I'll work night and day then 'til I
catch up."</p>

<p>"They ain't a-goin' to be no ketch up!" roared
Hurley. "Here ye be, an' here ye'll stay! Av ye
go out ye'll stay out!"</p>

<p>Connie looked the big boss squarely in the eye:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
"I'm sorry, Hurley. I've liked you, and I've
liked my job. But I've got to go. You'll find
the books all up to the minute." Hurley turned
away with a snort and rolled into his bunk, and a
few minutes later, Connie blew out the lamp and
crawled between his own warm blankets, where he
lay smiling to himself in the darkness.</p>

<p>By lamplight next morning the boy was astir.
He placed his few belongings in his turkey, and
when the task was accomplished he noticed that
Hurley was watching him out of the corner of his
eye. He tied the sack as the others sat upon the
edge of the bunks and drew on their boots. And
in silence they all crossed the dark clearing toward
the cook's camp.</p>

<p>With a great jangle of bells, Frenchy drew his
tote-team up before the door just as they finished
breakfast. Connie tossed his turkey into the
sleigh and turned to Hurley who stood by with Lon
Camden and Saginaw Ed. "I'll take my time,
now," said the boy, quietly. "And good luck to
you all!"</p>

<p>For answer the big boss reached over and, grabbing
the turkey, sent it spinning into the boy's
bunk. "Ye don't git no toime!" he bellowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
"Jump in wid Frenchy now, an' don't be shtandin'
'round doin' nawthin'. Tin days ye'll be gone at
the outsoide, an' av' ye ain't at yer disk here be th'
'leventh day, Oi'll br-reak ye in two an' grease
saws wid the two halves av ye!" Reaching into
his pocket, he drew forth a roll of bills. "How
much money d'ye nade? Come spake up! Ye
kin have all, or par-rt av ut&mdash;an' don't ye iver let
me hear ye talk av quittin' agin, er Oi'll woind a
peavy around yer head."</p>

<p>Connie declined the money and jumped into
the sleigh, and with a crack of the whip, Frenchy
sent the horses galloping down the tote road.
When they were well out of hearing the Frenchman
laughed. "Dat Hurley she lak for mak' de beeg
bluff, w'at you call; she mak' you scairt lak she gon'
keel you, an' den she giv' you all de mon' she got."</p>

<p>"He's the best boss in the woods!" cried the
boy.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i> dat rat. Ba goss, we'n she roar an' bluff,
dat ain' w'en you got for look out! Me&mdash;A'm
know 'bout dat. A'm seen heem lick 'bout fifty
men wan tam. Ovaire on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Frenchy&mdash;not fifty men."</p>

<p>"Well, was seex, anyhow. Ovaire on Leech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Lak' an' <i>sacre!</i> He ain' say nuttin', dat tam&mdash;joos'
mak' hees eyes leetle an' shine lak de <i>loup
cervier</i>&mdash;an' smash, smash, smash! An', by goss,
'bout twenty of dem feller, git de busted head."</p>

<p>Connie laughed, and during all the long miles of
the tote road he listened to the exaggerated and
garbled stories of the Frenchman&mdash;stories of log
drives, of fights, of bloody accidents, and of
"hants" and windagoes. At the railroad, the boy
helped the teamster and the storekeeper in the
loading of the sleigh until a long-drawn whistle
announced the approach of his train. When it
stopped at the tiny station, he climbed aboard,
and standing on the platform, waved his hand
until the two figures whisked from sight and
the train plunged between its flanking walls of
pine.</p>

<p>In Minneapolis Connie hunted up the office of
the Syndicate, which occupied an entire floor,
many stories above the sidewalk, of a tall building.
He was a very different looking Connie from the
roughly clad boy who had clambered onto the train
at Dogfish. A visit to a big department store had
transformed him from a lumberjack into a youth
whose clothing differed in no marked particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
from the clothing of those he passed upon the
street. But there was a difference that had
nothing whatever to do with clothing&mdash;a certain
something in the easy swing of his stride, the poise
of his shoulders, the healthy bronzed skin and the
clear blue eyes, that caused more than one person
to pause upon the sidewalk for a backward glance
at the boy.</p>

<p>Connie stepped from the elevator, hesitated
for a second before a heavily lettered opaque
glass door, then turned the knob and entered, to
find himself in a sort of pen formed by a low railing
in which was a swinging gate. Before him, beyond
the railing, dozens of girls sat at desks their fingers
fairly flying over the keys of their clicking typewriters.
Men with green shades over their eyes,
and queer black sleeves reaching from their wrists
to their elbows, sat at other desks. Along one side
of the great room stood a row of box-like offices,
each with a name lettered upon its glass door. So
engrossed was the boy in noting these details
that he started at the sound of a voice close beside
him. He looked down into the face of a girl who
sat before a complicated looking switchboard.</p>

<p>"Who do you wish to see?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Connie flushed to the roots of his hair. It was
almost the first time in his life that any girl had
spoken to him&mdash;and this one was smiling. Off
came his hat. "Is&mdash;is Heinie Metzger in?" he
managed to ask. Connie's was a voice tuned to
the big open places, and here in the office of the
Syndicate it boomed loudly&mdash;so loudly that the
girls at the nearer typewriters looked up swiftly and
then as swiftly stooped down to pick up imaginary
articles from the floor; the boy could see that they
were trying to suppress laughter. And the girl
at the switchboard? He glanced from the others
to this one who was close beside him. Her face
was red as his own, and she was coughing violently
into a tiny handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Caught cold?" he asked. "Get your feet dry,
and take a dose of quinine, and you'll be all right&mdash;if
you don't get pneumonia and die. If Heinie
ain't in I can come again." Somehow the boy
felt that he would like to be out of this place. He
felt stifled and very uncomfortable. He wondered
if girls always coughed into handkerchiefs or
clawed around on the floor to keep from laughing at
nothing. He hoped she would say that Heinie
Metzger was not in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you a card?" the girl had recovered from
her coughing fit, but her face was very red.</p>

<p>"A what?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"A card&mdash;your name."</p>

<p>"Oh, my name is Connie Morgan."</p>

<p>"And, your address?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"Ten Bow."</p>

<p>"Where? Is it in Minnesota?"</p>

<p>"No, it's in Alaska&mdash;and I wish I was back there
right now."</p>

<p>"And, your business?"</p>

<p>"I want to see Heinie Metzger about some logs."</p>

<p>A man passing the little gate in the railing
whirled and glared at him. He was a very disagreeable
looking young man with a fat, heavy
face, pouchy eyes of faded blue, and stiff, close-cropped
reddish hair that stuck straight up on his
head like pig's bristles. "Looks like he'd been
scrubbed," thought Connie as he returned glare
for glare. The man stepped through the gate and
thrust his face close to the boy's.</p>

<p>"Vat you mean, eh?"</p>

<p>"Are you Heinie Metzger?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I am not <i>Herr</i> Metzger. <i>Unt</i> it pays you
you shall be civil to your betters. You shall say
<i>Herr</i> Metzger, <i>oder</i> Mister Metzger. <i>Unt</i> he has
got not any time to be mit poys talking. Vat you
vanted? If you got pusiness, talk mit me. I am
<i>Herr</i> von Kuhlmann, confidential secretary to <i>Herr</i>
Metzger."</p>

<p>"I thought you were the barber," apologized the
boy. "But anyhow, you won't do. I want to see
Heinie Metzger, or 'hair' Metzger, or Mister
Metzger, whichever way you want it. I want to
sell him some logs."</p>

<p>The other sneered: "Logs! He wants to sell it
some logs! <i>Unt</i> how much logs you got&mdash;on de
vagon a load, maybe? Ve dondt fool mit logs
here, exceptingly ve get anyhow a trainload&mdash;<i>unt</i>
<i>Herr</i> Metzger dondt mention efen, less dan half a
million feets. Vere iss your logs?"</p>

<p>"I've got 'em in my pocket," answered the boy.
"Come on, Dutchy, you're wasting my time.
Trot along, now; and tell this Metzger there's a
fellow out here that's got about eight or nine
million feet of white pine to sell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vite pine! Eight million feets! You krasy?"
The man stooped and swung open the little gate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
"Come along <i>mit</i> me, <i>unt</i> if you trying some foolishness
<i>mit</i> <i>Herr</i> Metzger, you vish you vas some
blace else to have stayed avay." He paused before
a closed door, and drawing himself very
erect, knocked gently. A full minute of silence,
then from the interior came a rasping voice:</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"It is I, sir, von Kuhlmann, at your service,
<i>unt</i> I have <i>mit</i> me one small poy who say he has it
some logs to sell."</p>

<p>Again the voice rasped from behind the partition&mdash;a
thin voice, yet, in it's thinness, somehow
suggesting brutality: "Why should you come to
me? Why don't you buy his logs and send him
about his business?"</p>

<p>Von Kuhlmann cleared his throat nervously:
"He says it iss vite pine&mdash;eight million feets."</p>

<p>"Show him in, you fool! What are you standing
out there for?"</p>

<p>Von Kuhlmann opened the door and motioned
Connie to enter:</p>

<p>"<i>Herr</i> Morgan," he announced, bowing low.</p>

<p>"Connie Morgan," corrected the boy quickly,
as he stepped toward the desk and offered his hand
to the small, grey-haired man, with the enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
eyeglasses, and the fierce upturned mustache.
"I suppose you are Heinie Metzger," he announced.</p>

<p>The man glared at him, his thin nostrils a-quiver.
Then, in a dry, cackling voice, bade Connie be
seated, giving the extended hand the merest touch.
Von Kuhlmann withdrew noiselessly, and closed
the door. Metzger opened a drawer and drew
forth a box of cigars which he opened, and extended
toward the boy. Connie declined, and replacing
the cigars, the man drew from another drawer, a
box of cigarettes, and when the boy declined those
he leaned back in his chair and stared at Connie
through his glasses, as one would examine a specimen
at the zoo.</p>

HIS GLASSES, AS ONE WOULD EXAMINE A SPECIMEN AT THE ZOO.</div>
</div>

<p>"Young man, how do I know you have any
logs?" the question rasped suddenly from between
half-closed lips.</p>

<p>"You don't know it," answered the boy.
"That's why I came here to tell you."</p>

<p>"White pine, you said," snapped the man,
after a pause. "Eight million feet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, white pine&mdash;at least eight million, maybe
nine, and possibly more, if we continue to have
good luck."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a><br /><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are these logs?"</p>

<p>"On our landings on Dogfish River."</p>

<p>"Dogfish! You're the man from Alaska that
bought the McClusky tract?"</p>

<p>"I'm his partner."</p>

<p>"Show a profit last year?"</p>

<p>"No. But we only had one camp then, and this
year we have two and each one has cut more than
the one we had last year."</p>

<p>"Who did you sell to, last year?"</p>

<p>"Baker &amp; Crosby."</p>

<p>"Satisfied with their boom scale?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, we weren't. That's why we thought
we'd offer the cut to you this year, if you want it."</p>

<p>"Want it! Of course we want it&mdash;that is, if the
price is right."</p>

<p>"What will you pay?"</p>

<p><i>Herr</i> Heinrich Metzger removed his glasses and
dangled them by their wide black ribbon, as he
glanced along his thin nose. "Sure you can deliver
eight million feet?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, our foreman reports eight million already
on the rollways, or in the woods all ready for the
rollways. Yes, I can be sure of eight million."</p>

<p>"We have a big contract," said Metzger, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
is just about eight million feet short of being filled.
If we can be sure of getting the entire eight million
in one lump, we could afford to pay more&mdash;much
more, in fact, than we could if there was anything
short of eight million feet."</p>

<p>Connie nodded: "There will be eight million
feet, at least," he repeated. "What will you pay?"</p>

<p>For a long time the other was silent, then he
spoke: "It is a large deal," he said. "There are
many things to consider. Lest we make haste too
quickly, I must have time to consider the transaction
in all it's phases. Meet me here one week
from today, at eleven o'clock, and I will give you
a figure."</p>

<p>"A week is a long time," objected the boy,
"And I am a long way from home."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but there are others&mdash;associates of
mine in the business with whom I must consult."
The boy had risen to go, when the man stayed
him with a motion. "Wait," he commanded.
"Your name is&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Morgan&mdash;Connie Morgan."</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;Connie Morgan." He picked
the receiver from the hook of his desk phone.
"Get me the Laddison Hotel," he commanded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and hung up the receiver. "The delay is of my
own making, therefore I should pay for it. You
will move your luggage into the Laddison Hotel,
which is the best in the city, and shall remain there
until our deal is closed, at the expense of this company&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," objected the boy, "suppose the deal don't
go through?"</p>

<p>"The expense will be ours whether the deal goes
through or not. You see, I am confident that we
can deal."</p>

<p>The telephone rang and Metzger made the
arrangements, and again, turned to the boy.
"Each evening at dinner time, you are to ask at
the desk for an envelope. In the envelope you
will receive a ticket to the theatre. This, also, at
our expense." He smiled broadly. "You see, we
treat our guests well. We do not wish them to
become tired of our city, and we wish those with
whom we have dealings to think well of us."</p>

<span class="smaller">CONNIE SELLS SOME LOGS</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="dropleftmin">ONNIE MORGAN</span> left the office of the Syndicate,
and once more upon the sidewalk, filled
his lungs with the keen air. "It's going to work!"
"It's going to work!" he repeated over and over to
himself as he made his way toward the store where
he had left his discarded clothing stuffed into
a brand new brown leather suitcase. The boy
returned unhesitatingly to the store, not by means
of street signs, but by the simple process of back-trailing.
Trained in observation, his eyes had
unfailingly registered the landmarks in his brain&mdash;even
when that brain had been too busy wondering
what was to be the outcome of his conference
with Heinie Metzger, to know that it was receiving
impressions. It was this trained habit of observation
that had enabled him to select his wearing
apparel and the brown leather suitcase. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
simply studied the passengers on the train, and
selecting a man who looked well dressed, had copied
his apparel and even his suitcase.</p>

<p>The clerk at the store directed him to his hotel,
and a few minutes later he stood in the window of
a thickly carpeted room, and stared out over the
roofs of buildings. "It's&mdash;it's like the mountains,"
he mused, "stretching away, peak after peak, as
far as you can see, and the streets are the canyons
and the valleys&mdash;only this is more&mdash;lonesome."
Tiring of looking out over the roofs, he put on his
overcoat and spent the afternoon upon the streets,
admiring the goods in the store windows and
watching the people pass and repass upon the sidewalks.
It was a mild, sunshiny afternoon and
the streets were thronged with ladies, the browns,
and greys, and blacks, and whites of their furs
making a pretty kaleidoscope of colour.</p>

<p>At the Union Station he procured a folder and
after looking up the departure of trains, returned
to his hotel. He walked back at the time when
factories, stores, and office buildings were disgorging
their human flood onto the streets, and the
boy gazed about him in wonder as he elbowed his
way along the sidewalk. He smiled to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
"I guess I don't know much about cities. In the
store I was wondering where in the world they were
going to find the people to buy all the stuff they
had piled around, and when I was looking out the
window, I wondered if there were enough people in
the world to live in all the houses&mdash;and now I'm
wondering if there is enough stuff to go around, and
enough houses to hold 'em all."</p>

<p>In this room Connie glanced at his watch,
performed a hasty toilet, and hurried into the
elevator. "Gee, it's most six!" he muttered, "I
bet I'm late for supper." He was surprised to
find men in the lobby, sitting about in chairs or
talking in groups, as they had been doing when he
left in the afternoon. "Maybe they don't have it
'til six," he thought, and seating himself in a
leather chair, waited with his eyes on the clock.
Six o'clock came, and when the hand reached five
minutes after, he strolled to the desk. "Anything
here for me?" he asked. The clerk handed
him an envelope. "Heinie's making good,"
thought the boy, and then, trying not to look
hungry, he turned to the clerk: "Cook hollered
yet?" he asked casually.</p>

<p>The man smiled: "Grill's down stairs," he an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>nounced,
pointing to a marble stairway at the
other end of the room.</p>

<p>"I ain't too late, am I?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Too late! Too late for what?"</p>

<p>"For supper. It ain't over is it?"</p>

<p>"The grill is open from eight in the morning
until midnight," explained the man, and as Connie
turned away, he called after him: "Oh, Mr.
Morgan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Connie Morgan," corrected the boy gravely.</p>

<p>"Well, Connie, then&mdash;you are not to pay your
checks, just sign them and the waiter will take
care of them."</p>

<p>"That suits me," smiled Connie, and as he
crossed the tiled floor he muttered: "If they hadn't
wasted so much space making the office and rooms
so big, they wouldn't have to eat in the cellar.
In Fairbanks or Skagway they'd have made
four rooms out of that one of mine." At the door
of the grill a man in black met him, conducted him
through a maze of small tables at which men and
women were eating, and drew out a chair at a table
placed against the wall. Another man in black
appeared, filled a glass with water from a fat
bottle, and flipped a large piece of cardboard in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
front of him. Connie scanned the printed list with
puckered brow. Way down toward the bottom he
found three words he knew, they were tea, coffee,
milk. The man in black was waiting at his side
with a pencil poised above a small pad of paper.
"Go ahead, if you want to write," said the boy,
"I won't bother you any&mdash;I'm just trying to figure
out what some of these names mean."</p>

<p>"Waiting for your order, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't 'sir' me. You mean you're the waiter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm hungry, suppose you beat it out and
bring me my supper."</p>

<p>"What will it be, sir? I will take your order,
sir."</p>

<p>"Cut out that 'sir,' I told you. If these things
they've got down here stand for grub, you'll just
have to bring along the whole mess, and I'll pick
out what I want."</p>

<p>"Might I suggest, s&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here," interrupted the boy, grasping the
idea. "If any of these names stand for ham and
eggs, or beefsteak, or potatoes, or bread and
butter, you bring 'em along."</p>

<p>The man actually smiled, and Connie felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
relieved. "Whose place is that?" he indicated a
chair across the table.</p>

<p>"Not reserved, sir."</p>

<p>Connie glanced around the room: "You ain't
very busy, now. Might as well bring your own
grub along, and if you can ever remember to forget
that 'sir' business, we'll get along all right&mdash;I'm
lonesome."</p>

<p>When the waiter returned with a tray loaded
with good things to eat, Connie again indicated
the empty chair. "Against the rules," whispered
the waiter, remembering to leave off the "sir."</p>

<p>Connie did justice to the meal and when he had
finished, the man cleared the dishes away and set
a plate before him upon which was a small bowl
of water and a folded napkin. "What's that?"
asked the boy, "I drink out of a glass."</p>

<p>"Finger bowl," whispered the waiter. "Do you
wish a dessert?"</p>

<p>"Might take a chance on a piece of pie," answered
the boy, "here take this along. I washed
up-stairs."</p>

<p>When the waiter presented his check, Connie
took the pencil from his hand, signed it, and
passed it back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good. One moment, 'til I verify this at
the desk." He hurried away, and returned a
moment later. "Very good," he repeated.</p>

<p>Connie handed him a dollar: "I'm going to be
here a week," he said, "I want three good square
meals a day, and it's up to you to see that I get 'em.
No more lists of stuff I can't read. No more 'yes
sir,' 'no sir,' 'very good sir.'"</p>

<p>The waiter pocketed the dollar: "Thank you,
s&mdash;. Very good. Always come to this table. I
will reserve this place for you. You will find your
chair tilted, so. I shall speak to the head waiter."</p>

<p>Connie went directly to his room and putting
on his cap and overcoat, returned to the lobby and
again approached the man at the desk: "What time
does the show start?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Curtain rises at eight-fifteen."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>The boy reached for his envelope and handed the
ticket to the clerk.</p>

<p>"Metropolitan," informed the man, with a
glance at the cardboard. "Marquette, between
Third and Fourth." The boy glanced at the clock.
It was a quarter past seven. Hurrying to Nicollet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Avenue, he walked rapidly to the depot and accosted
a uniformed official: "Is the seven-fifty-five
for Brainard in yet?"</p>

<p>"Naw, third gate to yer right, where them folks
is waitin'."</p>

<p>Connie turned up his collar, pulled his cap well
down over his eyes, and strolled to the edge of the
knot of people that crowded close about one of the
iron gates. His eyes ran rapidly over each face in
the crowd without encountering the object of his
search, so he appropriated an inconspicuous seat on
a nearby bench between a man who was engrossed
in his newspaper, and an old woman who held a
large bundle up on her lap, and whose feet were
surrounded with other bundles and bags which she
insisted upon counting every few minutes. Closely
the boy scrutinized each new arrival as he joined
the waiting group. Beyond the iron grill were long
strings of lighted coaches to which were coupled
engines that panted eagerly as they awaited the
signal that would send them plunging away into
the night with their burden of human freight.</p>

<p>Other trains drew in, and Connie watched the
greetings of relatives and friends, as they rushed
to meet the inpouring stream of passengers. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
seemed to the lonely boy that everybody in the
world had someone waiting to welcome him but
himself. He swallowed once or twice, smiled a
trifle bitterly, and resumed his scrutiny of the
faces. A man bawled a string of names, there
was a sudden surging of the crowd which rapidly
melted as its members were spewed out into the
train shed. A few stragglers were still hurrying
through the gate. The hands of a clock pointed to
seven-fifty-four, and Connie stood up. As he did
so, a man catapulted down the stairs, and rushed
for the gate. He was a young man, clothed in the
garb of a woodsman, and as he passed him, Connie
recognized the heavy face of von Kuhlmann.</p>

<p>"That's just what I've been waiting for," he
spoke aloud to himself, after the manner of those
whose lives are cast in the solitudes. The man
glanced up from his newspaper, and the old woman
regarded him with a withering scowl, and gathered
her bundles more closely about her feet.</p>

<p>The play that evening was a musical comedy,
and during the entire performance the boy sat enthralled
by the music and the dazzling costumes.
He was still in a daze when he reached his hotel,
and once more stood in his room and gazed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
over the city of twinkling lights. He turned from
the window and surveyed his apartment, the thick
carpet, the huge brass bed, the white bath tub in
the tiny room adjoining, with its faucets for hot
and cold water, the big mirror that reflected his
image from head to foot&mdash;it seemed all of a piece
with the play.</p>

<p>Instantly the boy's imagination leaped the snow-locked
miles and he saw the tiny cabin on Ten
Bow, the nights on the snow-trail when he had
curled up in his blankets with the coldly gleaming
stars for his roof; he saw the rough camp on Dogfish
and in a flash he was back in the room once
more. "This ain't real <i>living</i>," he muttered, once
more glancing about him, "It's&mdash;it's like the show&mdash;like
living in a world of make-believe."</p>

<p>Undressing, he drew the white tub nearly full of
water. "I'm going to make it just as hot as I can
stand it. Any one can take a bath in cold water."
He wallowed in the tub for a long time, dried himself
with a coarse towel, and rummaging in his new
suitcase, produced a pair of pink pyjamas which
had been highly recommended by the clerk at the
big store. Very gingerly he donned the garments
and for some moments stood and viewed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a><br /><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
in the mirror. "Gee," he muttered, "I'm sure
glad Waseche Bill ain't here!" and switching
out the light, he dived into bed.</p>

MOMENTS STOOD AND VIEWED HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR.</div>
</div>

<p>Promptly at eleven o'clock, one week from the
day he arrived in Minneapolis, Connie Morgan
again presented himself at the office of the Syndicate.
That he had been expected was evidenced
by the fact that the girl at the switchboard did not
ask him any questions. She greeted him by name,
and touching a button beneath the edge of her desk
summoned a boy who conducted him to Metzger's
private office. The lumber magnate received him
with an oily smile: "Promptly on the minute," he
approved. "That's business. Sit here and we
will see whether two business men are able to make
their minds meet in a contract that will be profitable
to both." The man placed the points of his
fingers together and sighted across them at Connie.
"In the first place," he began, "the quantity
of logs. You are sure you can deliver here at our
mills at least eight million feet?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Because," continued the man, "owing to the
conditions of a contract we have on hand, any less
than eight million feet would be practically of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
value to us whatever. That is, we have concluded
to rely entirely upon your logs to fulfill our big
contract, and should you fail us, the other contract
would fail, and we would be at the expense of
marketing the lumber elsewhere."</p>

<p>"How much more than eight million feet could
you use?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"As much more as you can deliver. Say, anything
up to ten million."</p>

<p>Connie nodded: "That's all right," he assented,
"and the price?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;the price." Metzger frowned thoughtfully.
"What would you say to twenty dollars
a thousand?"</p>

<p>Connie shook his head. "I can get twenty-five
anywhere."</p>

<p>"Well, twenty-five?"</p>

<p>Again the boy shook his head. "You told me
you could pay liberally for the logs if you could be
sure of getting them all in one lot," he reminded.
"I can get twenty-five, anywhere, and by hunting
out my market I can boost it to thirty."</p>

<p>Metzger's frown deepened. "What is your
price?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fifty dollars!" The man rolled his eyes as if
imploring high heaven to look down upon the
extortion. "Ridiculous! Why the highest price
ever paid was forty!"</p>

<p>"We'll make a new record, then," answered the
boy calmly.</p>

<p>"Forty dollars&mdash;if you must have it," offered
the man. "Forty dollars or nothing. And, even
at forty, we must insist on inserting a protective
clause in the contract."</p>

<p>"A protective clause?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is this way. If we assume to pay such
an outrageous price for your logs, we must insist
upon being protected in case you fail to deliver.
Suppose, for instance, something prevented your
delivering the logs, or part of them at our mills.
Say, you could deliver only four or five million.
We could not pay forty dollars for them, because
our price is fixed with the understanding that we
are to receive eight million."</p>

<p>"That's fair enough," answered the boy; "we'll
fix that. If we don't deliver eight million,
then you take what we do deliver at twenty
dollars."</p>

<p>Metzger pondered. "And you will bind your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>self
to sell to us, and not to others, if you deliver
a short cut?"</p>

<p>"Sure we will."</p>

<p>"Well, there is fairness in your offer. We will
say, then, that we are to pay you forty dollars a
thousand for any amount between eight and ten
million, and only twenty dollars if you fail to
deliver at least eight million."</p>

<p>"I said fifty dollars," reminded the boy.</p>

<p>"And I say we cannot pay fifty! It is unheard
of! It is not to be thought of! It is exorbitant!"</p>

<p>Connie arose and reached for his cap: "All
right," he answered. "The deal's off." At the
door he paused, "I liked your hotel, and the shows,"
he said, but Metzger cut him short:</p>

<p>"The hotel and the shows!" he cried. "Bah! it is
nothing! Come back here. You are an extortionist!
You know you have us at your mercy, and
you are gouging us! It is an outrage!"</p>

<p>"See here, Metzger." The man flinched at the
use of his name, shorn of any respectful <i>Herr</i>, or
Mister. But he listened. "It's my business to
get as much for those logs as I can get. There is
nothing more to talk about. If you want 'em at
fifty dollars, take 'em, if you don't&mdash;good-bye."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Muttering and grumbling, the man motioned
him back to his seat. "We've got to have the
logs," he whined, "but it is a hard bargain you
drive. One does not look for such harshness in the
young. I am disappointed. How would forty-five
do?"</p>

<p>"Fifty."</p>

<p>"Well, fifty, then!" snapped Metzger, with a
great show of anger. "But look here, if we go up
ten dollars on our part, you come down ten dollars
on your part! We will pay fifty dollars a thousand
for all logs between eight and ten million&mdash;and
ten dollars a thousand for all logs delivered
short of eight million&mdash;and you bind yourself to
sell us your entire drive on those terms."</p>

<p>"That's a deal," answered the boy. "And our
crew to work with yours at the sorting gap. When
will you have the papers?"</p>

<p>"Come back at two," growled the man, shortly.</p>

<p>When Connie had gone, Metzger touched one of
a row of buttons upon his desk, and von Kuhlmann
entered, and standing at military attention, waited
for his superior to speak.</p>

<p>For a full minute Metzger kept him standing
without deigning to notice him. Then, scribbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
for a moment, he extended a paper toward his
subordinate. "Have a contract drawn in conformity
with these figures," he commanded.</p>

<p>Von Kuhlmann glanced at the paper. "He
agreed? As it iss so said here in America&mdash;he
bite?"</p>

<p>Metzger's thin lip writhed in a saturnine grin:
"Yes, he bit. I strung him along, and he has an
idea that he is a wonderful business man&mdash;to hold
out against me for his price. Ha, little did he
know that the top price interested me not at all!
It was the lesser figure that I was after&mdash;and you
see what it is, von Kuhlmann&mdash;<i>ten dollars a
thousand</i>!"</p>

<p>The other made a rapid mental calculation:
"On the deal, at five million feet, we make, at the
least, more than three hundred thousand!"</p>

<p>Metzger nodded: "Yes! That is business!"
he glared into von Kuhlmann's face, "This deal is
based on <i>your</i> report. If you have failed us&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Von Kuhlmann shuddered: "I haff not fail. I
haff been on Dogfish, and I haff mit mine eyes
seen the logs. I haff talk mit Hurley, the boss.
He iss mit us. Why should he not be mit us? We
pay him well for the logs from which comes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
paint off. He haff brand with the dissolving paint
three million feets. Mineself I apply vater <i>unt</i>
from the ends, I rub the paint, in each rollway,
here and there, a log."</p>

<p>Metzger pencilled some figures on a pad. "If
you have failed us," he repeated, "we pay <i>four
hundred thousand</i> dollars for eight million feet.
<i>Four hundred thousand!</i> And we lose forty dollars
a thousand on the whole eight million feet. Because
we expect to pay this Hurley ten dollars a
thousand for the three million feet branded with
the dissolving paint&mdash;and also to pay ten dollars a
thousand for the five million that will be delivered
under the contract." The man paused and brought
his fist down on the desk: "Ha, these Americans!"
the thin lips twisted in sneering contempt, "they
pride themselves upon their acumen&mdash;upon their
business ability. They boast of being a nation of
traders! They have pride of their great country
lying helpless as a babe&mdash;a swine contentedly
wallowing in its own fat, believing itself secure in
its flimsy sty&mdash;little heeding the Butcher, who
watches even as he whets his knife under the swine's
very eyes, waiting&mdash;waiting&mdash;waiting only for&mdash;<span class="smcap">The
Day</span>!" At the words both Metzger and von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Kuhlmann clicked their heels and came to a stiff
military salute. Standing Metzger, continued:
"Traders&mdash;business men&mdash;bah! It is the Germans
who are the traders&mdash;the business men of the
world. Into the very heart of their country we
reach, and they do not know it. Lumber here,
iron there, cotton, wool, railroads, banks&mdash;in their
own country, and under protection of their own
laws we have reached out our hands and have
taken; until today Germany holds the death-grip
upon American commerce, as some day she will
hold the death-grip upon America's very existence.
When the Butcher thrusts the knife the swine dies.
And, we, the supermen&mdash;the foremost in trade, in
arms, in science, in art, in thought&mdash;we, the Germans,
will that day come into our place in the sun!"</p>

<p>"<i>Der Tag!</i>" pronounced von Kuhlmann, reverently,
and with another clicking salute, he retired.</p>

<p>At two o'clock Connie found himself once more
in Metzger's office. The head of the Syndicate
handed him a copy of a typed paper which the
boy read carefully. Then, very carefully he read
it again.</p>

<p>"This seems to cover all the points. It suits me.
You made two copies, did you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Metzger nodded. "And, now we will sign?"
he asked, picking up a pen from the desk, and
touching a button. Von Kuhlmann appeared in
the doorway. "Just witness these signatures,"
said Metzger.</p>

<p>"If it's just the same to you, I saw Mike Gillum,
one of your foremen, waiting out there; I would
rather he witnessed the signing."</p>

<p>"What's this? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;only I know Mike Gillum. He's
honest. I'd like him to witness."</p>

<p>"Send Gillum in!" commanded Metzger, glaring
at the boy, and when the Irishman appeared,
he said brusquely. "Witness the signature to a
contract for the sale of some logs." Arranging
the papers he signed each copy with a flourish,
and offered the pen to Connie.</p>

<p>The boy smiled. "Why, I can't sign it," he
said. "You see, I'm a minor. It wouldn't be
legal. It wouldn't bind either one of us to anything.
If the deal didn't suit me after the logs
were here, I could claim that I had no right to
make the contract, and the courts would uphold
me. Or, if it didn't suit you, you could say 'It is a
mere scrap of paper.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Metzger jerked the thick glasses from his nose
and glared at the boy. "What now? You mean
you have no authority to make this contract?
You have been jesting? Making a fool of me&mdash;taking
up my time&mdash;living at my expense&mdash;and
all for nothing?"</p>

<p>Connie laughed at the irate magnate: "Oh, no&mdash;not
so bad as that. I have the authority to arrange
the terms because I am a partner. It is only the
legal part that interferes. Hurley, our walking
boss has the power of attorney signed by my partner,
who is not a minor. Hurley is authorized to
sell logs and incur indebtedness for us. I will
have to take those contracts up to our camp and
get his signature. Then everything will be O.K."</p>

<p>Metzger scowled: "Why did you not have this
Hurley here?"</p>

<p>"What, and leave a couple of hundred men idle
in the woods? That would not be good business,
would it? I'll take the contracts and have them
signed and witnessed, and return yours by registered
mail within two days."</p>

<p>The head of the Syndicate shot a keen sidewise
glance at the boy who was chatting with Mike
Gillum, as he selected a heavy envelope, slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the two copies of the contract into it, and passed
it over. Connie placed the envelope in an inner
pocket and, buttoning his coat tightly, bade Metzger
good-bye, and passed out of the door.</p>

<p>Alone in the office Metzger frowned at his desk,
he drew quick, thin lined figures upon his blotting
pad: "These Americans," he repeated contemptuously
under his breath. "To send a boy to do business
with <i>me</i>&mdash;a past master of business! The
fools! The smug, self-satisfied, helpless fools&mdash;I
know not whether to pity or to laugh! And, yet,
this boy has a certain sort of shrewdness. I had
relied, in case anything went wrong with our
plan, upon voiding the contract in court. However,
von Kuhlmann is clever. He has been this
week on the field. His judgment is unerring. <i>He
is German!</i>"</p>

<p>Late that evening, clad once more in his woodsman's
garb, Connie Morgan sat upon the plush
cushion of a railway coach, with his new leather
suitcase at his feet, and smiled at the friendly
twinkling lights of the farm-houses, as his train
rushed northward into the night.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE UNMASKING OF SLUE FOOT MAGEE</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="dropleftmin">ONNIE MORGAN</span> did not leave the train at
Dogfish Spur, but kept on to the county
seat. In the morning he hunted up the sheriff, a
bluff woodsman who, until his election to office,
had operated as an independent stumpage contractor.</p>

<p>"Did you arrest three I. W. W.'s in Mike Gillum's
camp on Willow River a while back?" he
asked, when the sheriff had offered him a chair
in his office in the little court-house.</p>

<p>"D'you mean those two-legged skunks that
tried to brain Hurley when he was bringin' 'em
in fer tryin' to burn out his camp?"</p>

<p>"Those are the ones."</p>

<p>"They're here. An' by the time they got here
they know'd they hadn't be'n on no Sunday-school
picnic, too. Doc swore out the warrants, an' I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
deputized Limber Bill Bradley, an' Blinky Hoy
to go an' fetch 'em in. 'Treat 'em kind,' I tells
'em when they started. But, judgin' by looks
when they got 'em out here, they didn't. You see,
them boys was brought up rough. Limber Bill
mixed it up with a bear one time, an' killed him
with a four-inch jack-knife, an' Blinky Hoy&mdash;they
say he eats buzz-saws fer breakfast. So here they
be, an' here they'll stay 'til June court. They
started hollerin' fer a p'liminary hearin', soon as
they got here, but I know'd Hurley was strainin'
hisself fer a good showin' this year, an' wouldn't
want to stop an' come down to testify, so I worked
a technicality on 'em to prevent the hearin'."</p>

<p>"A technicality?"</p>

<p>"Yeh, I shuck my fist in under their nose an'
told 'em if they demanded a hearing, they'd git it.
But it would be helt up in Hurley's camp, an'
Limber Bill, an' Blinky Hoy would chaperoon 'em
up, an' provided they was enough left of 'em to
bother with after the hearin' them same two
would fetch 'em back. So they changed their
minds about a hearin', and withdraw'd the
demand."</p>

<p>Connie laughed: "I'm Hurley's clerk, and I just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
dropped down to tell you that if those fellows
should happen to ask you how you got wind of
where they were hiding, you might tell them that
Slue Foot Magee tipped them off."</p>

<p>"If they'd happen to ask!" exclaimed the sheriff.
"They've b'en tryin' every which way they
know'd how to horn it out of me, ever since they
got out here. What about Slue Foot? I never
did trust that bird&mdash;never got nothin' on him&mdash;but
always livin' in hopes."</p>

<p>"I happen to know that Slue Foot is an I. W. W.,
and if these fellows think he doubled-crossed them,
they might loosen up with some interesting dope,
just to even things up. You see, it was Slue Foot
who advised them to go to Willow River."</p>

<p>"O-ho, so that's it!" grinned the sheriff.
"Well, mebbe, now they'll find that they <i>kin</i>
pump me a little after all."</p>

<p>"And while I'm here I may as well swear out
a couple of more warrants, too. You are a friend
of Hurley's, and you want to see him make good."</p>

<p>"You bet yer life I do! There's a man! He's
played in hard luck all his life, an' if he's got a
chanct to make good&mdash;I'm for him."</p>

<p>"Then hold off serving these warrants 'til just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
before the break-up. When the thaw comes, you
hurry up to Hurley's camp, and nab Slue Foot."
The sheriff nodded, and Connie continued: "First
I want him arrested for conspiring with the Syndicate
in the theft of thirty-four thousand dollars'
worth of logs during April and May of last year."</p>

<p>"With the Syndicate&mdash;stealin' logs!"</p>

<p>"Yes, if it hadn't been for that, Hurley would
have made good last year."</p>

<p>The sheriff's lips tightened: "If we can only rope
in Heinie Metzger! He ruined me on a dirty deal.
I had stumpage contracts with him. Then he
tried to beat me with his money for sheriff, but he
found out that John Grey had more friends in the
woods than the Syndicate had. Go on."</p>

<p>"Then, for conspiring to defraud certain sawyers
by shading their cut. Then, for the theft of three
thousand, five hundred dollars from Denny
O'Sullivan. And, last, for conspiracy with the
Syndicate to steal some three million feet of logs
this year."</p>

<p>The sheriff looked at the boy in open-eyed
astonishment. "D'you mean you kin <i>proove</i> all
this?"</p>

<p>"I think so. I can prove the theft of the money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and the shading the cut&mdash;when it comes to the
timber stealing, with the Syndicate's money back
of 'em, we'll have a harder time. But I've got the
evidence."</p>

<p>The sheriff grinned: "Well, when Slue Foot let
go, he let go all holts, didn't he? If you've got the
evidence to back you up, like you say you have,
Slue Foot'll be usin' a number instead of a name
fer the next lifetime er so."</p>

<p>Shortly after noon of the tenth day, following
his departure from camp, Connie stepped off the
train at Dogfish Spur, to find Frenchy waiting for
him with the tote-team. "Hurley say, 'you go
long an' git de kid. She gon' for com' today&mdash;tomor'&mdash;sure,
an' I ain' wan' heem git all tire out
walkin' in.' Hurley lak you fine an' Saginaw lak
you, but Slue Foot, she roar an' growl w'en you
ain' here. Bye-m-bye, Hurley tell heem 'shut oop
de mout', who's runnin' de camp?' an Slue Foot
gon' back to Camp Two mad lak tondaire."</p>

<p>The trip up was uneventful. Frenchy's "gran'
team" was in fine fettle, and just as the men were
filing into the cook's camp for supper, he swung the
team into the clearing with a magnificent whoop
and flourish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>After supper, in the office, Lon Camden began
to shuffle his reports, arranging them day by day
for the boy's convenience. Saginaw and Hurley
filled their pipes, and the former, with a vast
assumption of nonchalance, removed his boots and
cocked his heels upon the edge of his bunk. Hurley
hitched his chair about until it faced the boy,
and for a space of seconds glared at him through
narrowed eyes.</p>

<p>"Ye made a mistake to come back! Ye dhirty
little thayfe! An' me offerin' to lind ye money!"
The blood left Connie's face to rush back to it in
a surge of red, and his lips tightened. "Oh, ye
don't nade to pertind ye're insulted," the huge
man's voice trembled with suppressed rage. "Ye
had me fooled. Oi'd of soon caught wan av me
own b'ys in a dhirty game&mdash;Oi thought that well
av ye. But whin Slue Foot com' ragin' down
whin he heer'd ye'd gon' for a wake er so, Oi misthrusted
there was a rayson, so Oi tuk a luk at th'
books, an' ut didn't take me long to find out yer
dhirty cut-shadin' scheme."</p>

<p>Connie met the glare eye for eye. "Yes," he
answered, "it is a dirty deal, isn't it? I don't
blame you fer bein' mad. I was, too, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
threw in with it&mdash;so mad I came near spilling the
beans."</p>

<p>Hurley was staring open mouthed. "Well, av
all th' nerve!" he choked out the words.</p>

<p>"But I held onto myself," continued the boy,
"and now we've got the goods on Slue Foot&mdash;four
ways from the jack. You noticed I kept a record
of just how much has been shaved off from each
man's cut? If I hadn't you would never have
tumbled to the deal, no matter how long you
studied the books. We are going to return that
money to the sawyers who have it coming&mdash;but not
yet. We want those false vouchers issued first.
By the way, how much do you figure we've got on
the landings, now?"</p>

<p>"Eight million, seven hundred thousan'&mdash;and
clost to three hundred thousan' layin' down. Th'
thaw's right now in th' air&mdash;'an we're t'rough cuttin'.
Tomorrow all hands wor-rks gittin' the logs
to the rollways. But what's that to ye? An'
what d'ye mane settin' there ca'm as a lake on a
shtill noight, an' admittin' ye wuz in on a low-down
swindle? An-ny wan 'ud think ye wuz
accused av shwoipin' a doughnut off the cook!"</p>

<p>"I'll come to that directly," answered the boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
"First, I wish you'd sign this contract. Saginaw
or Lon will witness the signature. And we can
get it into the mail tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Contrack!" roared Hurley, snatching the
paper from the boy's hand. The boss's eyes ran
rapidly over the typewritten page, and with a low
exclamation he moved the chair to the light.
For ten minutes there was tense silence in the little
office. Then Hurley looked up. "Fifty dollars a
thousan'!" he gasped. "Fer an-nything from eight
to tin million! Tin dollars a thousan', fer an-nything
less nor eight million! From th' Syndicate!" With
a bellow of rage the big boss leaped from his chair
and stood over the boy. "Niver Oi've wanted to
paste a man so bad!" he foamed. "Oi said ye wuz
shmar-rt&mdash;an' ye ar-re. But ye ain't shmar-rt
enough to put this over on me&mdash;ye an' Slue Fut&mdash;yer
game is bushted!" He shook the paper under
the boy's nose. "Somehow, ye figger on soide-thrackin'
enough av thim logs to turn in less
thin eight million&mdash;an the Syndicate gits the
cut fer tin dollars a thousan'&mdash;an' ye an' Slue
Fut divoides up the price av the logs that's
missin'."</p>

<p>Connie laughed. "You've hit the idea pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
well, boss&mdash;only you've got the wrong boot on the
wrong foot."</p>

<p>"What d'ye mane wid yer boots and futs? Oi
see yer game, an' Oi know now ut it wuz Slue Fut
had a hand in the lasht year's loosin'. Wait
'til Oi git me hands on thot dhirty cur! Wait&mdash;"
In his wrath the man hurled the paper to the floor,
and reached for his mackinaw with one hand, and
his peavy with the other.</p>

<p>Lon Camden sat looking on with bulging eyes,
and beyond the stove Saginaw Ed shook with silent
mirth as he wriggled his toes in his thick
woollen socks.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Hurley," said Connie, as he rescued
the precious contract from the floor. "Just sit
down a minute and let's get this thing straight.
As soon as the thaw sets in, John Grey will be up
to tend to Slue Foot. I swore out three or four
warrants against him, besides what the I. W. W.'s
are going to spill."</p>

<p>"John Grey&mdash;warrants&mdash;I. W. W.'s." The man
stood as one bewildered. "An' the kid ca'm as
butter, flashin' contracks aroun' th' office, an'
ownin' up he's a thayfe&mdash;an' Saginaw a-laughin' to
hisself." He passed a rough hand across his fore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>head
as the peavy crashed to the floor. "Mebbe,
ut's all here," he babbled weakly. "Mebbe thim
I. W. W.'s give me wan crack too many&mdash;an' me
brain's let go."</p>

<p>"Your brain's all right," said Connie. "Just sit
down and light your pipe, and forget you're mad,
and listen while I explain."</p>

<p>Hurley sank slowly into his chair: "Sure, jist
fergit Oi'm mad. Jist set by quiet an' let ye ate
th' doughnut ye shwoiped off th' cook. Don't
say nawthin' whoilst ye an' Slue Fut an' the
Syndicate steals th' whole outfit. Mebbe if Oi'd
take a little nap, ut wid be handier fer yez."
The man's words rolled in ponderous sarcasm.
Lon Camden arose and fumbled in his turkey. A
moment later he tendered the boss a small screw-corked
flask.</p>

<p>"I know it's again' orders in the woods, boss.
But I ain't a drinkin' man&mdash;only keep this in case
of accident. Mebbe a little nip now would
straighten you out."</p>

<p>Hurley waved the flask aside: "No, Oi'm off thot
stuff fer good! Ut done me har-rm in me younger
days&mdash;but ut kin do me no more. Av Oi ain't
going crazy, Oi don't nade ut. Av Oi am, ut's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
betther to be crazy an' sober, thin crazy an' drunk.
Go on, b'y. Ye was goin' to mention somethin',
Oi believe&mdash;an' av me name's Jake Hurley, ut betther
be a chinful. In the first place, what business
ye got wid contracks, an' warrants, an-nyhow?"</p>

<p>"In the first place," grinned the boy, "I'm a
partner of Waseche Bill, and one of the owners
of this outfit. Here are the papers to show it."
While Hurley studied the papers, Connie proceeded:
"We got your report, and then a letter from Mike
Gillum saying that you were in the pay of the
Syndicate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hurley leaped to his feet: "Moike Gillum says
Oi wuz in the pay of th' Syndicate! He's a
dhirty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I know all about that. Slue Foot
is the man who is in the pay of the Syndicate&mdash;and
he borrowed your name." Hurley subsided,
somewhat, but his huge fists continued to clench
and unclench as the boy talked. "So I came
down to see what the trouble was. It didn't take
me long, after I had been with you for a while,
to find out that you are square as a die&mdash;and that
Slue Foot is as crooked as the trail of a snake. I
pretended to throw in with him, and he let me in on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the cut-shading&mdash;and later on the big steal&mdash;the
scheme they worked on you last winter, that
turned a twenty-thousand-dollar profit into a
fourteen-thousand-dollar loss. When I got onto
his game, I asked for a leave of absence and went
down and closed the deal with the Syndicate&mdash;or
rather, I let Heinie Metzger and von Kuhlmann
close a deal with me. I had doped it all out that,
if Metzger believed Slue Foot could prevent the
delivery of part of the logs, he'd offer most anything
for the whole eight million, because he knew
he would never have to pay it, providing he could
get the figure way down on anything less than
eight million. So I stuck out for fifty dollars a
thousand on the eight million, and he pretended
it was just tearing his heart out; at the same time I
let him get me down to ten dollars a thousand on
the short cut&mdash;And we don't care how little he
offered for that, because <i>we're going to deliver the
whole cut</i>!"</p>

<p>Hurley was staring into the boy's face in open-mouthed
incredulity. "An' ye mane to say, ye
wint to Minneapolis an' hunted up Heinie Metzger
hisself, an' let him make a contrack that'll lose
him three or foor hundred thousan' dollars?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Heinie Metzger&mdash;the shrewdest lumberman in the
wor-rld. Th' man that's busted more good honest
min than he kin count! Th' man that howlds th'
big woods in the holler av his hand! An' ye&mdash;a
b'y, wid no hair on his face, done thot? Done ut
deliberate&mdash;figgered out befoor hand how to make
Heinie Metzger bate hisself&mdash;an' thin went down
an' <i>done ut</i>?"</p>

<p>Connie laughed: "Sure, I did. Honestly, it was
so easy it is a shame to take the money. Heinie
Metzger ain't shrewd&mdash;he just thinks he is&mdash;and
people have taken him at his own valuation. I
told Saginaw the whole thing, before I went
down. Didn't I, Saginaw?"</p>

<p>"You sure did. But I didn't think they was
any such thing as puttin' it acrost. An' they's
a whole lot more yet the kid's did, boss. Fer one
thing, he's got them three I. W. W. 's locked in jail.
An'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hurley waved his arm weakly: "Thot's enough&mdash;an'
more thin enough fer wan avenin'. Th'
rist Oi'll take in small doses." He struggled into
his mackinaw and reached fer the peavy that
lay where it had fallen beside the stove.</p>

<p>"Where ye headin', boss?" asked Saginaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"Camp Two. Oi've a little conference to howld
with the boss up there."</p>

<p>Lon Camden removed his pipe and spat accurately
and judiciously into the woodbox. "The
kid's right, Hurley," he said. "Let John Grey
handle Slue Foot. All reason says so. If anything
should happen to you just before the drive,
where'd the kid's contract be? He's done his
part, givin' the Syndicate the first good wallop
it ever got&mdash;now it's up to you to do yourn. If
you lay Slue Foot out, when John Grey comes he
wouldn't have no choist but to take you along&mdash;so
either way, we'd lose out."</p>

<p>"But," roared Hurley, "s'pose John Grey don't
show up befoor the drive? Thin Slue Fut'll be
free to plot an' kape us from deliverin' thim logs."</p>

<p>"Slue Foot's done!" cried Connie. "He can't
hurt us now. You see, the Syndicate people
furnished him with a paint that looks just like the
regular branding paint. When the logs have
been in the water a short time the paint all comes
off&mdash;And, last year, with you bossing the rear
drive, by the time they got to the mills all the
logs they dared to steal were wearing the green
triple X."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"An' ye mane he's got thot wash-off stuff on
them logs now?"</p>

<p>"On about three million feet of 'em," answered
the boy. "All we've got to do is to sit tight until
John Grey comes for Slue Foot, and then put a
crew to work and brand the logs with regular paint
and get 'em into the water." The boy laughed
aloud, "And you bet I want to be right at the
sorting gap, when old Heinie Metzger sees the
sixth, and seventh, and eighth, and ninth million
come floating along&mdash;with the red block-and-ball
bobbing all shiny and wet in the sun! Oh, man!
Old Heinie, with his eyeglasses, and his store
clothes!"</p>

<p>Hurley banged the peavy down upon the wooden
floor. "An' ut's proud Oi'll be to be sthandin' be
yer soide whin them logs rolls in. Ut's as ye say,
best to let th' law deal with Slue Foot. Yez
nade have no fear&mdash;from now on 'til John Grey
sets fut in th' clearin'&mdash;fer all an-ny wan w'd know,
me an' Slue Foot could be brother-in-laws."</p>

<span class="smaller">CONNIE DELIVERS HIS LOGS</span></h2>


<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HE</span> following days were busy ones in the two
camps in Dogfish. Connie worked day and
night to catch up on his books, and while Saginaw
superintended the building of the huge bateau,
and the smoothing out of the rollways, Hurley and
Slue Foot kept the rest of the crew at work hauling
logs to the landings. Spring came on with a rush,
and the fast softening snow made it necessary for
the hauling to be done at night. The thud of axes,
the whine of saws, and the long crash of falling
trees, was heard no more in the camps, while all
night long the woods resounded to the calls of
teamsters and swampers, as huge loads of logs were
added to the millions of feet already on the rollways.</p>

<p>Then came a night when the thermometer failed
to drop to the freezing point. The sky hung
heavy with a thick grey blanket of clouds, a steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
drenching rain set in, and the loggers knew that so
far as the woods were concerned, their work was
done. Only a few logs remained to be hauled,
and Hurley ordered these peeled and snaked to the
skidways to await the next season.</p>

<p>The men sang and danced in the bunkhouse
that night to the wheeze of an accordion and the
screech of an old fiddle. They crowded the few
belongings which they would take out of the woods
with them into ridiculously small compass, and
talked joyfully and boisterously of the drive&mdash;for,
of all the work of the woods it is the drive men most
love. And of all work men find to do, the log
drive on a swollen, quick-water river is the most
dangerous, the most gruelling, and the most torturing,
when for days and nights on end, following
along rough shores, fighting underbrush, rocks, and
backwater, clothing half torn from their bodies,
and the remnants that remain wet to their skin,
sleeping in cat-naps upon the wet ground, eating
out of their hands as they follow the logs, cheating
death by a hair as they leap from log to log, or
swarm out to break a jam&mdash;of all work, the most
gruelling, yet of all work the most loved by the
white-water birlers of the north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning water was flowing on top of the
ice on Dogfish, and the big bateau was man-hauled
to the bank and loaded with supplies and a
portable stove. Strong lines were loaded into her,
and extra axes, pickpoles, and peavys, and then,
holding themselves ready to man the river at a
moment's notice, the crew waited.</p>

<p>And that morning, also appeared John Grey,
worn out and wet to the middle by his all night's
battle with the deep, saturated slush of the tote
road. He had started from Dogfish with a horse
and a side-bar buggy, but after a few miles, he had
given up the attempt to drive through, and had
unharnessed the horse and turned it loose to find
its way back, while he pushed on on foot. After
a prodigious meal, the sheriff turned in and slept
until noon. When he awoke, his eyes rested for a
moment on Connie, and he turned to Hurley:
"Quite some of a clerk you got holt of, this season,
Jake," he said, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"Yeh," replied Hurley, drily. "He's done
fairly good&mdash;for a greener. I mistrusted, after
he'd be'n in here a spell, that he wasn't just a pick-up
of a kid&mdash;but, I didn't hardly think he'd turn
out to be the owner."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"Owner?"</p>

<p>"Yup. Him an' his pardner owns this timber,
an' the kid come down to find out what the trouble
was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Y'ain't tellin' me a kid like him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yup&mdash;they come that way&mdash;up in Alasky.
He's put in a year with the Canady Mounted, too.
I ain't a-braggin' him up none, but I'm right here
to tell you that what that there kid don't know
ain't in the books&mdash;an' he kin put over things that
makes the smartest men me an' you ever heer'd
of look like pikers."</p>

<p>John Grey smiled, and the boss continued: "Oh,
you needn't laff! Old Heinie Metzger busted
<i>you</i>, didn't he? An' he busted a-many another
good man. But this here kid slipped down an'
put a contrack over on him that'll cost him between
three an' four hundred thousand dollars of
his heart's blood. The contrack is all signed and
delivered, an' when Dogfish lets go tonight or tomorrow,
the logs'll start."</p>

<p>"Where is Slue Foot?" asked the sheriff, after
listening to Hurley's explanation.</p>

<p>"Up to Camp Two, we'll be goin' up there now.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>Me an' you an' the kid an' Lon'll go long. An' a crew
of men with paint buckets and brushes. Saginaw,
he'll have to stay here to boss the breakin' out of the
rollways, in case she let's go before we git back."</p>

<p>At the edge of Camp Two's clearing Hurley
called a halt: "We'll wait here 'til the kid gits
Slue Foot's signature to them vouchers. When
ye git 'em kid, open the door an' spit out into the
snow&mdash;then we'll come."</p>

<p>"I'll just keep out these," grinned Slue Foot, as
he selected the false vouchers from the sheaf of
good ones, "so them birds don't git no chanct to
double-cross me. You've done yer part first rate,
kid. There's a little better than three million feet
on the rollways that'll be wearin' the green triple
X again they hit the sortin' gap. Von Kuhlmann
was up here hisself to make sure, an' they's goin'
to be a bunch of coin in it fer us&mdash;because he says
how the owner is down to Minneapolis an' contracted
fer the whole cut, an' old Heinie Metzger
made a contrack that'll bust this here Alasky gent.
He'll be so sick of the timber game, he'll run every
time he hears the word log spoke. An' Hurley&mdash;he's
broke fer good an' all. I be'n layin' to git him
good&mdash;an' I done it, an' at the same time, I made a
stake fer myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Connie nodded, and opening the door, spat into the
snow. A moment later there was a scraping of feet.
The door opened, and John Grey, closely followed
by Hurley and Lon Camden, entered the office.</p>

<p>"Hullo, John," greeted Slue Foot. "Huntin'
someone, er be ye up here tryin' to git some pointers
on how to make money loggin'?"</p>

<p>The sheriff flushed angrily at the taunt: "A little
of both, I guess," he answered evenly.</p>

<p>"Who you huntin'?"</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>"Me! What d'you want of me? What I be'n
doin'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin' to speak of. Countin' the four
warrants the kid, here, swore out, I only got nine
agin ye&mdash;the other five is on information swore to
by yer three friends down in jail."</p>

<p>With a roar of hate, Slue Foot sprang straight at
Connie, but Hurley who had been expecting just
such a move, met him half way&mdash;met his face with
a huge fist that had behind it all the venom of the
big boss's pent-up wrath. Slue Foot crashed into
a corner, and when he regained his feet two steel
bracelets coupled with a chain encircled his wrists.
The man glared in sullen defiance while the sheriff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
read the warrants arising out of the information of
the three I. W. W.'s. But when he came to the
warrants Connie had sworn out, the man flew into
a fury of impotent rage&mdash;a fury that gradually
subsided as the enormity of the offences dawned
on him and he sank cowering into a chair, wincing
visibly as he listened to the fateful words. "So
you see," concluded the sheriff, "the State of Minnesota
is mighty interested in you, Slue Foot,
so much interested that I shouldn't wonder if it
would decide to pay yer board and lodgin' fer the
rest of yer natural life."</p>

<p>"If I go over the road there'll be others that
goes too. There's them in Minneapolis that holds
their nose pretty high that's into this as deep as me.
An' if I kin knock a few years offen my own time,
by turnin' State's evidence, yer kin bet yer life I'll
spill a mouthful." Suddenly he turned on Connie:
"An' you," he screamed, "you dirty little double-crosser!
What be you gittin' out of this?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered the boy, "as soon as the
crew out there on the rollways get the red block-and-ball
in good honest paint on the ends of those
logs, I'll get quite a lot out of it. You see I own
the timber."</p>

<div class="caption multiline">HURLEY HAD REMAINED AT THE UPPER CAMP, AND AS THE DRIVE
AT LAST BEGAN TO THIN OUT, HE CAME FLOATING DOWN, STANDING
ERECT UPON A HUGE LOG.</div>
</div>

<p>Just at daylight the following morning the
Dogfish River burst its prison of ice and "let go"
with a rush and a grind of broken cakes; breakfast
was bolted, and the men of the drive swarmed to
the bank where they stood by to break-out the
rollways as soon as the logs from the upper Camp
began to thin out. Connie stood beside the big
bateau with the cook and John Grey and watched
Camp Two's drive rush past&mdash;a floating floor of
logs that spanned the river from bank to bank.
Hurley had remained at the upper Camp and as
the drive at last began to thin out, he came floating
down, standing erect upon a huge log. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
opposite the camp the big boss leaped nimbly from
log to log until he reached the bank, where Saginaw
stood ready to order out the breaking out of
the first rollway. Many of the men of the upper
drive had passed, riding as Hurley had done upon
logs&mdash;others straggled along the shore, watching
to see that no trouble started at the bends, and
still others formed the rear drive whose business it
was to keep the stranded logs and the jill-pokes
moving.</p>

<p>So busy were all hands watching the logs that
nobody noticed the manacled Slue Foot crawl
stealthily from the bateau and slip to the river's
brink. A big log nosed into shore and the former
boss of Camp Two leaped onto it, his weight sending
it out into the current. The plan might have
worked, for the next bend would have thrown Slue
Foot's log to the opposite bank of the river before
any one could possibly have interfered, but luck
willed otherwise, for the moment the unfortunate
Slue Foot chose as the moment of his escape was the
same moment Saginaw Ed gave the word for the
breaking-out of the first rollway. There was a
sharp order, a few well-directed blows of axes, a
loud snapping of toggle-pins, and with a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
roar the towering pile of logs shot down the steep
bank and took the river with a splash that sent a
wave of water before it.</p>

<p>Then it was that the horrified spectators saw
Slue Foot, his log caught in the wave, frantically
endeavouring to control, with his calked boots, its
roll and pitch. For a moment it seemed as if he
might succeed, but the second rollway let go and
hurtled after the first, and then the third, and the
fourth&mdash;rolling over each other, forcing the tumbling,
heaving, forefront farther and farther into
the stream, and nearer and nearer to Slue Foot's
wildly pitching log. By this time word had
passed to the men at the rollways and the fifth was
held, but too late to save Slue Foot, for a moment
later the great brown mass of rolling tumbling logs
reached him, and before the eyes of the whole
crew, the boss of Camp Two disappeared for ever,
and the great brown mass rolled on.</p>

<p>"Mebbe ut's best," said Hurley, as with a
shudder he turned away, "'tis a man's way to die&mdash;in
the river&mdash;an' if they's an-ny wan waitin' fer him
um back there, they'll think he died loike a man."
In the next breath he bellowed an order and the
work of the rollways went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at the first of his cleverly planned obstructions
that Hurley overtook the head of the drive,
and it was there that he encountered Long Leaf
Olson and the men of the Syndicate crew.</p>

<p>Long Leaf was ranting and roaring up and down
the bank, vainly ordering his men to break the
jam, and calling malediction upon the logs, the
crew, river, and every foot of land its water lapped.
Hurley had ordered Saginaw to the rear drive,
promising to hold the waters back with his jams,
and now he approached the irate Long Leaf, a
sack of dynamite over his shoulder and a hundred
picked men of his two crews at his back.</p>

<p>"Call yer men off thim logs!" he bellowed,
"Thim's my logs on the head end, an' I want 'em
where they're at."</p>

<p>"Go on back to the rear end where you belong!"
screeched Long Leaf; "I'll learn you to git fresh
with a Syndicate drive! Who d'you think you be,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Oi'll show ye who I be, ye Skanjehoovyan
Swade! An' Oi'll show ye who's runnin' this
drive! Oi'm bossin' th' head ind mesilf an' Saginaw
Ed's bossin' the rear, an' av ye've fouled our
drive, ye'll play the game our way! What do Oi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
care fer yer Syndicate? Ye ain't boss of nawthin'
on this river this year&mdash;ye' ain't aven boss of the
bend-watchers!"</p>

<p>Long Leaf, who's river supremacy had heretofore
been undisputed, for the simple reason that no
outfit had dared to incur the wrath of the Syndicate,
stared at the huge Irishman in astonishment.
Then placing his fingers to his lips he gave a peculiar
whistle, and instantly men swarmed from the jam,
and others appeared as if by magic from the woods.
In a close-packed mob, they centred about
their boss. "Go git 'em!" roared Long Leaf,
beside himself with rage. "Chase the tooth-pickers
off the river!"</p>

<p>"Aye, come on!" cried Hurley. "Come on yez
spalpeens! Come on, chase us off th' river&mdash;an'
whoilst yer chasin' ye bether sind wan av ye down
to Owld Heinie fer to ship up a big bunch av long
black boxes wid shiney handles, er they'll be a
whole lot of lumberjacks that won't go out av the
woods at all, this spring!"</p>

<p>As the men listened to the challenge they gazed
uneasily toward the crew at Hurley's back. One
hundred strong they stood and each man that did
not carry an axe or a peavy, had thoughtfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
provided himself with a serviceable peeled club of
about the thickness of his wrist.</p>

<p>"Git at 'em!" roared Long Leaf, jumping up and
down in his tracks. But the men hesitated,
moved forward a few steps, and stopped.</p>

<p>"They hain't nawthin' in my contrack calls fer
gittin' a cracked bean," said one, loud enough to
be heard by the others. "Ner mine," "ner
mine," "ner mine." "Let old Metzger fight his
own battles, he ain't never done nawthin' to me but
skinned me on the wanagan." "What would we git
if we did risk our head?" "Probably git docked
fer the time we put in fightin'." Rapidly the
mutiny spread, each man taking his cue from the
utterance of his neighbour, and a few minutes
later they all retired, threw themselves upon the
wet ground, and left Long Leaf to face Hurley alone.</p>

<p>"Git out av me road," cried the big Irishman,
"befoor Oi put a shtick av giant in under ye an'
blow ye out!" Long Leaf backed away and,
proceeding to a point opposite the jam, Hurley
seated himself upon a log, and calmly filled his pipe.</p>

<p>"If you think you're bossin' this drive, why in
tarnation ain't you busted this jam," growled
Long Leaf, as he came up a few minutes later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"They ain't no hurry, me b'y, not a bit of a
hurry. They'll be another wan just a moile above
th' mouth. Ut's a way good river-min has got
to let the rear drive ketch up."</p>

<p>"You wait 'til Metzger hears of this!" fumed
Long Leaf.</p>

<p>Hurley laughed: "Oi'll be there at th' tellin'.
An' you wait 'til Metzger sees eight er noine
million feet av my logs slidin' t'rough his sortin'
gap&mdash;an' him havin' to pay fifty dollars a thousand
fer um. D'ye think he'll doie av a stroke, er
will he blow up?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;eight million&mdash;fifty dollars&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hurley laughed tantalizingly: "Wait an' see.
'Twill be worth th' proice av admission." And
not another word could Long Leaf get out of him.</p>

<p>During the previous summer Hurley had studied
his ground well. For several miles above the jam
the river flowed between high banks, and it was
that fact that made his scheme practicable, for had
the land extended back from the river in wide flats
or meadows, the backwater from the jam would
have scattered his drive far and wide over the
country. It was mid-afternoon when the rear-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>drive
crew came up and then it was that Hurley,
bearing a bundle of yellow cylinders, crept out
along the face of the jam. A quarter of an hour
later he came crawling back and joined the men
who watched from the edge of the timber. Five
minutes passed and the silence of the woods was
shattered by a dull boom. The whole mass of
logs that had lain, heaped like jack-straws in the
bed of the river, seemed to lift bodily. A few logs
in the forefront were hurled into the air to fall with
a noisy splash into the river, or with a crash upon
the trembling mass that settled slowly into the
stream again. For an instant the bristling wall
quivered uncertainly, moved slowly forward, hesitated,
and then with a roar, the centre shot forward,
the sides tumbled in upon the logs that rushed
through from behind, and the great drive moved.</p>

<p>The breaking of the second jam was a repetition
of the first, and when the drive hit the big river
there were left on the bars and rock-ledges of the
Dogfish only a few stragglers that later could be
dry-rolled by a small crew into the stream and
rafted down.</p>

<p>The crew worked indefatigably. Lumbermen
said it was as pretty a drive as ever took water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
In the cook's bateau Connie and Steve worked like
Trojans to serve the men with hot coffee and handouts
that were kept on tap every minute of the day
and night.</p>

<p>At the various dams along the great river the
boy never tired of standing beside Hurley and
watching the logs sluiced through, and at last, with
Anoka behind them, it was with a wildly beating
heart that he stepped into a skiff and took his
place in the stern beside Hurley, while the brawny
men of the sorting crew worked their way to the
front of the drive.</p>

<p>As the black smudge that hovered over the city
of mills deepened, the boy gazed behind him at
the river of logs&mdash;his logs, for the most part; a
mighty pride of achievement welled up within him&mdash;the
just pride of a winter's work well done.</p>

<p>News of the drive had evidently preceded them,
for when the skiff reached the landing of the
Syndicate's sorting gap, the first persons the boy
saw, standing at the end of the platform, apart
from the men of the sorting crew, were Metzger
and von Kuhlmann.</p>

<p>The former greeting Connie with his oily smile.
"Ah, here we have the youthful financier, himself,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
he purred. "He has accompanied his logs all the
way down the river, counting them and putting
them to bed each night, like the good mother looks
after the children. I am prepared to believe that
he has even named each log."</p>

<p>"That's right," answered the boy evenly. "The
first log to come through is named Heinie, and the
last log is named Connie&mdash;and between the two
of them there are four hundred and fifty thousand
dollars' worth of assorted ones&mdash;you're going to
pay for them&mdash;so I left the naming to you."</p>

<p>Metzger shot him a keen glance: "How many
logs have you brought down?"</p>

<p>"About nine million feet of mine, and about
three million and a half of yours&mdash;from your Dogfish
Camp&mdash;at least that's what we estimated when
we sluiced through at Anoka."</p>

<p>Von Kuhlmann had turned white as paper:
"Where's Hurley?" he asked in a shaky voice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/i-p-309.jpg" width="370" height="394" alt="" id="ILLUS_309" /><br />
<div class="caption multiline">CONNIE PLACED HIS HAND AFFECTIONATELY UPON THE ARM OF
THE BIG BOSS WHO STOOD AT HIS SIDE GRINNING BROADLY.</div>
</div>

<p>Connie placed his hand affectionately upon the
arm of the big boss who stood at his side grinning
broadly: "This is Jake Hurley&mdash;my foreman,"
he announced, and then to the boss: "The old
one is Heinie Metzger, and the shaky one's von
Kuhlmann."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," faltered von Kuhlmann&mdash;"there iss
some mistake! Hurley I haff seen&mdash;I know him.
I say he iss not Hurley! There iss a mistake!"</p>

<p>"Yes, there's a mistake all right&mdash;and you made
it," laughed the boy. "And it's a mistake that
cost your boss, there, dearly. The man you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
been dealing with was not Hurley at all. He passed
himself off for Hurley, and last year he got away with
it. Your game is up&mdash;you crooks! The three million
feet that Slue Foot Magee, alias Hurley, branded
with your disappearing paint, have all been repainted
with good, honest, waterproof paint&mdash;and, <i>here
they come!</i>" As the boy spoke, a log scraped along
the sheer-boom, and for a moment all eyes rested
upon the red block-and-ball, then instantly lifted
to the thousands of logs that followed it.</p>

<p>Several days later when the boom scale had
been verified, Connie again presented himself at
the office of the Syndicate and was shown immediately
to Metzger's private room. The magnate
received him with deference, even placing a chair
for him with his own hands. "I hardly know how
to begin, <i>Herr</i> Morgan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Connie Morgan</i>," snapped the boy. "And as
far as I can see you can begin by dating a check
for four hundred and forty-eight thousand, three
hundred and twenty dollars&mdash;and then you can
finish by signing it, and handing it over."</p>

<p>"But, my dear young man, the price is exorbitant&mdash;my
stockholders in Germany&mdash;they will not
understand. It will be my ruin."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why did you agree to it then? Why did you
sign the contract?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you do not understand! Allow me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand this much," said Connie, his eyes
flickering with wrath, "that you'd have held me to
my bargain and taken my logs for ten dollars a
thousand, and ruined me, if I hadn't been wise to
your dirty game."</p>

<p>"Ah, no! We should have adjusted&mdash;should
have compromised. I would have been unwilling
to see you lose! And yet, you would see me lose&mdash;everything&mdash;my
position&mdash;my friends in Germany&mdash;surely
your heart is not so hard. There should
be fellowship among lumbermen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that the reason you ruined John Grey, and
Lige Britton, and Lafe Weston, and poor old Jim
Buck? Every one of them as square a man as
ever lived&mdash;and every one of them an independent
logger, 'til you ruined them! What did you answer
when they sat right in this office and begged for
a little more time&mdash;a little more credit&mdash;a little
waiver of toll here and there? Answer me that!
You bloodsucking weasel!" The cowardly whine
of the beaten German made the boy furious. He was
upon his feet, now, pounding the desk with his fist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>A crafty gleam shot from Metzger's eyes, and
abruptly he changed his tactics: "Let us not abuse
each other. It is probable we can come to an
agreement. You are smart. Come in with us. I
can use you&mdash;in von Kuhlmann's place. I paid
von Kuhlmann eighteen-hundred a year. Make a
concession to me on the contract and I will employ
you with a ten year contract, at ten thousand a
year. We are a big corporation; we will crush
out the little ones! I can even offer you stock.
We will tighten our grip on the timber. We will
show these Americans&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the boy, his voice trembling
with fury, "we'll show these Americans&mdash;we'll
show 'em what <i>fools</i> they are to allow a lot of
wolves from across the water to come over here and
grab off the best we've got. I'm an American!
And I'm proud of it! And what's more, I'll give
you just five minutes to write that check, Metzger,
and if it isn't in my hands when the time's up, I'll
get out an attachment that'll tie up every dollar's
worth of property you own in the State, from the
mills to your farthest camp. I'll tie up your logs
on the rollways&mdash;and by the time you get the
thing untangled you won't have water enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
get them to the river. You've got three minutes
and a half left."</p>

<p>Slowly, with shaking fingers, Metzger drew
the check, and without a word, passed it over to
Connie, who studied it minutely, and then thrust
it into his pocket. At the door he turned and
looked back at Metzger who had sloughed low in
his chair.</p>

<p>"If you'd listened to those other men&mdash;John
Grey and the others you've busted, when they
were asking for favours that meant nothing to
you, but meant ruin to them if you withheld them&mdash;if
you'd played the game square and decent&mdash;you
wouldn't be busted now. And, when you get
back to Germany, you might tell your friends over
there that unless they change their tactics, someday,
something is going to happen that will wake
America up! And if you're a fair specimen of
your kind, when America does wake up, it will be
good-bye Germany!" And as the door slammed
upon the boy's heels, Metzger for a reason unaccountable
to himself shuddered.</p>

<p class="p2">It tells how "Sam Morgan's Boy,"
well known to readers of Mr. Hendryx's
"Connie Morgan in Alaska," daringly
rescued a man who was rushing to destruction
on an ice floe and how, in recognition
of his quick-wittedness and
nerve, he was made a Special Constable
in the Northwest Mounted Police, with
the exceptional adventures that fell to
his lot in that perilous service. It is a
story of the northern wilderness, clean
and bracing as the vigorous, untainted
winds that sweep over that region;
the story of a boy who wins out
against the craft of Indians and the guile
of the bad white man of the North; the
story of a boy who succeeds where men
fail.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. Hendryx, as he has ably demonstrated
in his many well-known tales,
knows his Northland thoroughly, but
he has achieved a reputation as a writer
possibly "too strong" for the younger
literary digestion. It is a delight,
therefore, to find that he can present
properly, in a capital story of a boy,
full of action and adventure, and one in
whom boys delight, the same thorough
knowledge of people and customs
of the North.</p>

<p class="p2">The story of a search for treasure which lies guarded
by the fastnesses of nature in the ragged interior of
Alaska. The penetration of these wilds by the boys who
are the heroes of the story is a thrilling narrative of
adventure, and with every step of the journey the lore
of the open is learned. The reader follows them through
the mountains wreathed in misty enchantment, over
swollen rivers, into inviting valleys, until the great discovery
of gold is made, and then the adventure does
not close but may be said to reach its height, for a
wily good-for-nothing, who, under false pretenses, has
inveigled in his scheme some men innocent of wicked
intent, attempts to steal the prize, and there follows a
race of days through the northland, involving innumerable
dangers and culminating in a splendid rescue.</p>

<p class="p2">A sequel to <i>The Quest of the Golden Valley</i>,
this time taking the chums through the vicissitudes
of an Alaskan winter. They trap the
many fur-bearing animals, hunt the big game,
camp with the Indians, do dog-driving, snow-shoeing,
etc. With the coming of spring they
descend one of the wilderness rivers on a raft
and at the eleventh hour, after being wrecked
in a dangerous canyon, they discover a fabulous
quartz lode, and succeed in reaching the sea
coast.</p>
